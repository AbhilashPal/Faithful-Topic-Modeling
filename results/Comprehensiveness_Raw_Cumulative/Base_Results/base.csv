Lunar Planetary Laboratory Tucson AZ Lines 89 In article Brian Kendig writes I ve asked your god several times with all my heart to come to me I really wish I could believe in him cos no matter how much confidence I build up on my own the universe is a big place and it would be so nice to know I have someone watching over me in it Brian K I am pleased with your honesty And to be honest as well I believe you have not asked my god to come to you Why do I say this Because by the things you write on the net and the manner with which you write them you show me that you made up your own god and are attempting to pass him off as the real thing I got news for you Yours doesn t at all sound like mine Your god doesn t come to you because your god doesn t exist I ve gone into this with an open mind I ve layed my beliefs aside from time to time when I ve had doubt and I ve prayed to see what good that would do I don t see what more I can do to open myself to your god short of just deciding to believe for no good reason And if I decide to believe for no good reason why not believe in some other god Zeus seems like a pretty cool candidate I am sorry Brian but when I read your postings I do not see an open mind What I do see is misunderstanding lack of knowledge arrogance and mockery Please tell me what more I can do while still remaining true to myself Be true to yourself then Have an open mind And so end the mockery Gain knowledge of the real God Put your presumptions aside Read the Bible and know that there is truly is a reason for everything and there exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond our shallow worldly experience A person who commits himself to seeking God will find God Jesus stands at your door and knocks But a person who half heartedly opens the Bible or opens it with purpose to find something to mock will find learn and see nothing The only thing one will gain with that attitude is folly Be careful to not jump the gun for at first glance there are many passages in the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd Be assured that even though they seem alien at first be confident that they are not Be assured that beyond your present comprehension there lies such deep reasons that once you see them you will indeed be satisfied I will personally guarantee that one As Jesus put it You will never be thirsty again Your cup will even flow over From King Solomon 970 B C to 930 B C It is the glory of God to conceal a matter to search out a matter is the glory of kings Jesus says in John 6 44 55 No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him And in John 3 16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life You are included in whosoever And I also pray that the Father is drawing you which it seems He is doing else you wouldn t be posting to talk religion misc Remember Brian you could be a St Paul in the making Paul not only mocked Christians as you do but also had pleasure stoning them Yet God showed him mercy saved him and Paul became on of the most celebrated men in the history of God s church You see Brian I myself better be careful and not judge you because you could indeed be the next Paul For with the fervor that you attack Christians one day you might find yourself one and like Paul proclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more Or you could be the next Peter What Jesus said to Peter Jesus would probably say to you Satan would surely like to have you Why so Because Peter was hard headed cynical and demonstrated great moments of stupidity but once Peter committed himself to a task he did with full heart Peter was the only apostle to have the faith to walk on water as Jesus did You asked Why not believe in Zeus Zeus didn t offer eternal life You got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus Brian Ceccarelli', 'From Brian Kendig Subject Re Is it good that Jesus died Organization

are their own masters because they fear it they are too afraid of having to face the world on their own terms Are you your own master Do you have any habits that you cannot break If I have a habit that I really want to break and I am willing to make whatever sacrifice I need to make to break it then I do so There have been bad habits of mine that I ve decided to put forth the effort to break and I ve done so there have been other bad habits that I ve decided are not worth the effort to break It s my choice either way I am my own master I choose what I want to do I weigh the benefits of my actions against their consequences and I use my experience to help me deal with the unexpected which in turn make me more experienced I don t always succeed but I never fail either I learn Do you have any habits you can t break Why not For one you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the Bible I have arrived at my own understanding of Christianity just as you ve probably arrived at your own understanding of Islam that is most likely very different from the way a Moslem thinks of his religion Are you unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the Quran If that s different then how is it different from what you accuse me of Can I accuse you of having no desire to understand even the slightest concept of atheism How about sexual sins Gotta any of those secret desires in your head that you harbor but can get control of Do you dehumanize women when they walk past you Do you degrade them to a sex object in your head Of COURSE not That s disgusting For centuries religions have been discriminating on sex and treating women as second class humans that s one of the reasons I renounced my Christianity Do you insult people unknowingly then regret it later Yet do it again the next time opportunity presents itself No I don t insult people Period It s not in my nature and it s not something that I want to do either Are you truly the master of yourself Not yet but my life is the ground I use to practice on The fun is in the getting there I have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all times That I sometimes say things I do want to say and then repeat my mistake unwantingly I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect of my being There are times I know I shouldn t say something but then say it anyway There are times I simply forget a lesson I in fact am not my own master We don t start out perfect we ve got to strive to be something better I know my shortcomings and I know my strengths and I live my life according to the decisions I make and I am content to abide with the consequences of my decisions as easily as I ll accept the praise for them There have been times in my life when I ve made mistakes yes I try to never make the same mistake twice I need help Jesus promised me this help And I took him up on his offer I have willfully let Jesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than I myself do I regard Christ as a myth I feel that there are far too many people offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and did The only person who can really judge me is me I choose the roads I travel and I decide whether or not I want to reach the end of any given road or turn back and as long as I don t always turn back there s no shame in it When I need help I seek out my friends Do you see my point I think you re the one under the rock and I m getting a great tan out here in the sunlight My life has improved immesurably since I abandoned theism come and join me It will be a difficult trip at first until you build up your muscles for the long hike but it s well worth it Then I guess ignorance is bliss for you Because Brian you enjoy not having a clue about the Bible And you don t have a clue about what I m saying either Open your eyes and SEE open your ears and LISTEN I m not just spouting off empty words This is my LIFE this is what gives me MEANING Don t you see I m not going to accept ANYTHING that I can t witness with my own eyes or experience with my own senses especially not something as mega powerful as what you re trying to get me to accept Surely if you believe in it this strongly you must have a good reason to don t you Can you witness motherly love with your senses How does caring and concern for you register with your senses If nothing registers to you other than what you can see taste smell hear and touch then you better become a Vulcan and fast You better get rid of your emotions Huh You re going WAY off the track here I say my mother loves me How do I know you ask I can point to definite things she s done for me and I can even just bring her to you so you can ask her face to face You say your deity loves you How do you know I ask You can t even convince me that it exists My God says that you will not CEASE EXISTING You have life forever You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal torment where there is no communication whatsoever or can choose to live it in paradise with God That is what my God says And that was the issue Your made up theism is what it is made up It s wishful thinking If any god dangles heaven before me like a carrot promising untold pleasures to me if I ll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my rationality for just this once then I would choose hell I can not lie to myself to placate another being no matter how powerful it is Note also that there are several gods trying to lure me this way Yahweh Allah Zeus Odin Ra Please give me a solid reason to choose one of them over the others description of Kendigism deleted hee hee Why would you want to live a good life To you you die and that s it Don t contradict yourself You have no reason to live a good life It doesn t do you any good in the end Your life doesn t do anybody else any good either because everyone dies anyway So you have no reason to lead a good life Leading a good life is meaningless Why do you do such a meaningless thing That paragraph demonstrates that you haven t listened to a single word I ve said Have you ever gone to an amusement park Why I mean after a few hours it closes and nothing s different except that you re a few dollars lighter Going to the amusement park doesn t do you any good at all Why do you do such a meaningless thing The answer is that you think it s fun You play the skee ball over and over because you d like to get better at it even though you re not going to win anything better than a stuffed animal even if you blow ten dollars on it You ride the roller coaster because it s an thrilling experience even though because it scares the dickens out of you In the same way I think life is fun And I don t intend to leave the amusement park of life until they close down for the night D I m sorry I don t feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god I d worship would do unless the sacrifice was only temporary in which case it s not really all that important Has the resurrection sunk in Jesus is alive Jesus is NOT dead So you and your holy book say By the same token therefore

registered Although some books demonstrate that the current implementation of Xt happens to call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered the specification does not guarantee such a sequence and supplemental authoritative documents i e the Asente Swick volume do say that the order is undefined Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and the application Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution In general the callback procedures should be thought of as operating independently of one another and should not depend on side effects of other callbacks operating if a seqence is needed then the single callback to be registered can explicitly call other functions necessary 4 92 thanks to Subject 122 Why doesn t XtDestroyWidget actually destroy the widget XtDestroyWidget operates in two passes in order to avoid leaving dangling data structures the function call marks the widget which is not actually destroyed until your program returns to its event loop Subject 123 How do I query the user synchronously using Xt It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback which has a clear flow of control The calls to AskUser block

answer answer AskUser w Really Quit if RET_YES answer answer AskUser w Are You Really Positive if RET_YES answer exit 0 A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether to overwrite it This is accomplished by entering a second event processing loop and waiting until the user answers the question the answer is returned to the calling function That function AskUser looks something like this where the Motif can be replaced with widget set specific code to create some sort of dialog box displaying the question string and buttons for OK Cancel and Help or equivalents int

function which will work on both widgets and non widget objects If you are still using R3 you can use this simple bit of code to do what you want Note that it depends on the widget s internal data structures and is not necessarily portable to future versions of Xt including R4 include X11 CoreP h include X11 Xresource h String XtName widget Widget widget WILL work with non widget objects return

into which I can do Xlib graphics within my Xt based program canvas XtCreateManagedWidget widgetClass drawing area window XtWindow canvas get the window associated with the widget XDrawLine window produces error The window associated with the widget is created as a part of the realization of the widget Using a window id of NULL no window could create the error that you describe It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget before attempting to use the window associated with a widget Note that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget call but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet so you should also wait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it Subject 126 Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage The BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of the screen If you don t want to catch the error and deal with it you can take the following steps to avoid the error 1 Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture 2 Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle 3 Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap 4 If you get a NoExpose event the copy was clean Use XGetImage to grab the image from the pixmap 5 If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events the copy wasn t clean and the x y width height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you the parts of the pixmap which aren t good 6 Get rid of the pixmap it probably takes a lot of memory 10 92 thanks to Oliver Jones Subject 127 How can my application tell if it is being run under X A number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight character only mode The easiest way for an application to determine that it is running on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server display XOpenDisplay display_name if display do X stuff else do curses or something else where display_name is either the string specified on the command line following display by convention or otherwise is char NULL in which case XOpenDisplay uses the value of DISPLAY if set This is superior to simply checking for the existence a display command line argument or checking for DISPLAY set in the environment neither of which is adequate 5 91 Subject 128 How do I make a busy cursor while my application is computing Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor for every window in my application The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is as large as the largest possible screen make it a child of your toplevel window and it will be clipped to that window so it won t affect any other application It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual desktop Substitute toplevel with your top most widget here similar code should work for Xlib only applications just use your top Window unsigned long valuemask XSetWindowAttributes attributes Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed valuemask CWDontPropagate CWCursor attributes do_not_propagate_mask KeyPressMask KeyReleaseMask ButtonPressMask ButtonReleaseMask PointerMotionMask attributes cursor XCreateFontCursor XtDisplay toplevel XC_watch The window will be as big as the display screen and clipped by its own parent window so we never have to worry about resizing XCreateWindow XtDisplay

avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than 32767 When you want to use this busy cursor map and raise this window to go back to normal unmap it This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse events depending on precisely how the window manager works it may or may not have a similar effect on keystrokes as well In addition note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor resource which can be temporarily reset should you merely wish to change the cursor without blocking pointer events thanks to Andrew Wason Dan Heller and 11 90 5 91 Subject 129 How do I fork without hanging my parent X program An X based application which spawns off other Unix processes which continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its children are terminated the children inherit from the parent the open X connection to the display What you need to do is fork then immediately in the child process close ConnectionNumber XtDisplay widget to close the file descriptor in the display information After this do your exec You will then be able to exit the parent Alternatively before exec ing make this call which causes the file descriptor to be closed on exec void fcntl ConnectionNumber XDisplay F_SETFD 1 Thanks to Janet Anstett Gordon Freedman 2 91 Greg Holmberg 3 93 Subject 130 Can I make Xt or Xlib calls from a signal handler No Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical sections If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time which might be while the function you are calling is already executing it can leave the library in an inconsistent state Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal itself so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions You can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which has previously been added Note the article in The X Journal 1 4 and the example in O Reilly Volume 6 are in error Thanks to Pete Ware and Donna Converse 5 92 Subject 131 What are these Xlib sequence lost errors You may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error handler or more likely if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or Xlib from a signal handler which you shouldn t be doing in any case Subject 132 How can my Xt program handle socket pipe or file input It s very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input both from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor but which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or the other file descriptor A solution is use XtAppAddInput After you open your file descriptor use XtAppAddInput to register an input handler The input handler will be called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your program s attention Write the input handler like you would any other Xt callback so it does its work quickly and returns It is important to use only non blocking I O system calls in your input handlers Most input handlers read the file descriptor although you can have an input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish Be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file You will find that the function is called even when there isn t input pending XtAppAddInput is actually working as it is supposed to The input handler is called whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read not only when there is new data to be read A disk file unlike a pipe or socket is almost always ready to be read however if only because you can spin back to the beginning and read data you ve read before The result is that your function will almost always be called every time around XtAppMainLoop There is a way to get the type of interaction you are expecting add this line to the beginning of your function to test whether there is new data if ioctl fd FIONREAD n 1 n 0 return But because this is called frequently your application is effectively in a busy wait you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput and instead setting a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input courtesy Dan Heller 8 90 5 91 Ollie Jones 6 92 Subject 133 How do I simulate a button press release event for a widget You can do this using XSendEvent it s likely that you re not setting the window field in the event which Xt needs in order to match to the widget which should receive the event If you re sending events to your own application then you can use XtDispatchEvent instead This is more efficient than XSendEvent in that you avoid a round trip to the server Depending on how well the widget was written you may be able to call its action procedures in order to get the effects you want courtesy Mark A Horstman 11 90 Subject 134 Why doesn t anything appear when I run this simple program the_window XCreateSimpleWindow the_display root_window size_hints x size_hints y size_hints width size_hints height BORDER_WIDTH BlackPixel the_display the_screen WhitePixel the_display the_screen XSelectInput the_display the_window ExposureMask ButtonPressMask ButtonReleaseMask XMapWindow the_display the_window XDrawLine the_display the_window the_GC 5 5 100 100 You are right to map the window before drawing into it However the window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen until your application receives an Expose event Drawing done before that will generally not appear You ll see code like this in many programs this code would appear after window was created and mapped while done XNextEvent the_display the_event switch the_event type case Expose On expose events redraw XDrawLine the_display the_window the_GC 5 5 100 100 break Note that there is a second problem some Xlib implementations don t set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground background colors so this program could previously include this code the_GC_values foreground BlackPixel the_display the_screen e g the_GC_values background WhitePixel the_display the_screen e g the_GC XCreateGC the_display the_window GCForeground GCBackground the_GC_values Note the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is black and 0 is white or vice versa The relationship between pixels 0 and 1 and the colors black and white is implementation dependent They may be reversed or they may not even correspond to black and white at all Also note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong thing to do in a finished program as it ignores the user s preference for foreground and background And also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt based program if you draw into the XtWindow w right after it has been realized it may not yet have appeared Subject 135 What is the difference between a Screen and a screen The Screen is an Xlib structure which includes the information about one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports A server can support several independent screens They are numbered unix 0 0 unix 0 1 unix 0 2 etc the screen or screen_number is the second digit the 0 1 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available Screens on this particular Display connection The macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular Screen on which your application is running typically have two forms one which takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number In Xt based programs you typically use XtScreen widget to determine the Screen on which your application is running if it uses a single screen Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros which return characteristics of the Screen have Display in the names XDisplayWidth XDisplayHeight etc Subject 136 Can I use C with X11 Motif XView The X11R4 5 header files

XGetWindowAttributes get a window s background pixel pixmap No Once set the background pixel or pixmap of a window cannot be re read by clients The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap set it to be the background pixmap of a window and then free the pixmap The window keeps this background but the pixmap itself is destroyed If you re sure a window has a background pixel not a pixmap you can use XClearArea to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage to read back that pixel However this action alters the contents of the window and it suffers from race conditions with exposures courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun Note that the same applies to the border pixel pixmap This is a mis feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the pixel pixmap however it wants By not requiring the server to keep the original pixel or pixmap some potentially a lot of space can be saved courtesy Jim Fulton MIT X Consortium Subject 139 How do I create a transparent window A completely transparent window is easy to get use an InputOnly window In order to create a window which is mostly transparent you have several choices the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way to make non rectangular windows so you can set the shape of the window to fit the areas where the window should be nontransparent however not all servers support the extension a machine specific method of implementing transparent windows for particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware Note that there is no X notion of a transparent color index a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny windows but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application window with information if so you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors that will appear properly thanks to der Mouse 3 92 see also The X Journal 1 4 for a more complete answer including code samples for this last option Subject 140 Why doesn t GXxor produce mathematically correct color values When using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a background of black for example should produce white However the drawing operation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices The color that the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually random unless you have actually filled it in yourself On many X servers Black and White often 0 1 or 1 0 programs taking advantage of this mathematical coincidence will break If you want to be combining colors with GXxor then you should be allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen pre computed values If you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors then you can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC graphics context to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over red say the result is blue and when it draws over blue the result is red This foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and blue Thanks to Chris Flatters and Ken Whaley 2 91 Subject 141 Why does every color I allocate show up as black Make sure you re using 16 bits and not 8 The red green and blue fields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is full blast If you forget to scale using for example 0 255 for each color the XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is usually black Thanks to Paul Asente 7 91 Subject 142 Why can t my program get a standard colormap I have an image processing program which uses XGetRGBColormap to get the standard colormap but it doesn t work XGetRGBColormap when used with the property XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP does not create a standard colormap it just returns one if one already exists Use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first 1 91 from der Mouse Subject 143 Why does the pixmap I copy to the screen show up as garbage The initial contents of pixmaps are undefined This means that most servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there which is usually garbage You probably want to clear the pixmap first using XFillRectangle with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever color you want as your background or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a mask courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun Subject 144 How do I check whether a window ID is valid My program has the ID of a window on a remote display I want to check whether the window exists before doing anything with it Because X is asynchronous there isn t a guarantee that the window would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an event to the window or otherwise manipulated it What you should do is send the event without checking but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow errors which would indicate that the window no longer exists This scheme will work except on the rare occasion that the original window has been destroyed and its ID reallocated to another window courtesy Ken Lee 4 90 Subject 145 Can I have two applications draw to the same window Yes The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources actually the server assigns some bits the client others and any application that knows the ID can manipulate the resource almost any X server resource except for GCs and private color cells can be shared The problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple applications A simple way to handle this and which solves the problem of the applications running on different machines is in the first application to create a specially named property on the root window and put the window ID into it The second application then retrieves the property whose name it also knows and then can draw whatever it wants into the window Note this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first application running and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned in the Question about using window IDs on remote displays Note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher level cooperation among your applications Note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to use the same server connection If one process is a child of the other it should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection mostly courtesy Phil Karlton 6 90 Subject 146 Why can t my program work with tvtwm or swm A number of applications including xwd xwininfo and xsetroot do not handle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use they typically return the wrong child of root A general solution is to add this code or to use it in your own application where you would normally use RootWindow dpy screen Function Name

can include this header file first to run properly in the presence of a virtual desktop Subject 147 How do I keep a window from being resized by the user Resizing the window is done through the window manager window managers can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window but there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen You can try setting the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best 1 91 Subject 148 How do I keep a window in the foreground at all times It s rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself e g by tracking VisibilityNotify events so that it isn t overlapped imagine the conflict between two such programs running The only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack is to make the window override redirect this means that you are temporarily assuming window management duties while the window is up so you want to do this infrequently and then only for short periods of time e g for popup menus or other short parameter setting windows thanks to der Mouse 7 92 Subject 149 How do I make text and bitmaps blink in X There is no easy way Unless you re willing to depend on some sort of extension as yet non existent you have to arrange for the blinking yourself either by redrawing the contents periodically or if possible by playing games with the colormap and changing the color of the contents Thanks to der Mouse 7 91 Subject 150 How do I get a double click in Xlib Users of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help get notification of double clicking There is no good way to get only a double click in Xlib because the protocol does not provide enough support to do double clicks You have to do client side timeouts unless the single click action is such that you can defer actually taking it until you next see an event from the server Thus you have to do timeouts which means system dependent code On most UNIXish implementations you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of the X connection and then use select or something similar on that Note that many user interface references suggest that a double click be used to extend the action indicated by a single click if this is the case in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it too should be the single click action or the double click action Thanks to der Mouse 4 93 Subject 151 How do I render rotated text Xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics capabilities leaving them up to server extensions or clients side graphics libraries Your only choice if you want to stay within the core X protocol is to render the text into a pixmap read it back via XGetImage rotate it by hand with whatever matrices you want and put it back to the server via XPutImage more specifically 1 create a bitmap B and write your text to it 2 create an XYBitmap image I from B via XGetImage 3 create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation 4 for each x y in I2 I2 x y I a b where a x cos theta y sin theta b x sin theta y cos theta 5 render I2 Note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose bits an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better The high level server extensions and graphics packages available for X also permit rendering of rotated text Display PostScript PEX PHiGS and GKS although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the same fonts that would be found on a printer In addition if you have enough access to the server to install a font on it you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some predefined angle Your application can then itself figure out placement of each glyph courtesy der Mouse Eric Taylor and Ken Lee 11 90 Liam Quin 12 90 InterViews C UI toolkit in the X contrib software has support for rendering rotated fonts in X It could be one source of example code Brian R Smith 3 91 Another possibility is to use the Hershey Fonts they are stroke rendered and can be used by X by converting them into XDrawLine requests 10 91

shar Z O Reilly s X Resource Volume 3 includes information from HP about modifications to the X fonts server which provide for rotated and scaled text Subject 152 What is the X Registry How do I reserve names There are places in the X Toolkit in applications and in the X protocol that define and use string names The context is such that conflicts are possible if different components use the same name for different things The MIT X Consortium maintains a registry of names in these domains orgainization names selection names selection targets resource types application classes and class extension record types and several others The list as of 7 91 is in the directory mit doc Registry on the R5 tape it is also available by sending send docs registry to the xstuff mail server To

Expires Sat 1 May 1993 04 00 00 GMT Distribution usa Organization University Of Kentucky Dept of Math Sciences Lines 169 In article David M Tate writes I ve read all of the followups to this but I thought I d go back to the original article to make specific comments about the method John Oswalt said He has obtained the play by play records in computer readable form for every major league baseball game for the past several years He devised an algorithm which I call sum over situations and wrote a computer program to calculate every major league players contribution using it It works like this Look at every situation in every game in a baseball season A situation is determined by inning score where the baserunners are and how many outs there are For each situation count how many times the team eventually won the game that the situation occured in and divide by the number of times the situation came up to come up with a value for that situation This was first done by George Lindsey in the late 50s early 60s and reported in Article An Investigation of Strategies in Baseball Author George R Lindsey Journal Operations Research Issue Volume 11 4 July August 1963 pp 477 501 Later Pete Palmer did the same thing using simulated seasons to generate a larger set of data to avoid the kind of small sample anomalies that other people have worried about He reported this in _The_Hidden_Game_of_Baseball_ with John Thorn Gary Skoog modified the method a bit and did some work on what he called a Value Added measure based on these situational values His were based directly on marginal runs though not on win probabilities These results as applied to the 198 season were reported in one of the Bill James Baseball Abstract books 1987 Help me out here somebody For example a situation might be inning 3 score 2 0 runner on second and no outs There were 4212 regular season major league games last year With the Rockies and Marlins there will be more this year Say this situation came up in 100 of those and the team ahead won 75 of them Then the value of this situation is 0 75 Description of method look at change in win probability based on the at bat plus any baserunning and credit debit the player by that amount each time he gets a plate appearance Now for each player sum up all his at bat and base running values for the season to obtain an overall value for that player Obviously the sum of all players values for each game and for the season as a whole will be 0 That s only because you always credit x to the batter and x to the pitcher there s no validation involved OK there s a very big problem here that nobody has yet commented on you re adding probabilities and probabilities don t add Runs you can add the total team runs breaks down into how many runs Joe contributed plus how many runs Fred contributed etc But probabilities don t work that way If Bob increases his team s chance of winning by 1 in each of 400 PAs that does not mean that Bob increased his team s chance of winning by 400 In fact it doesn t mean anything because the units are screwy I agree and disagree John is saying that the batters efforts will result in 4 more wins then losses While you are probably correct that 400 does not mean 4 more wins then losses it means something I would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1 in each of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning by 5 in each of 400 PAs Thus there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between John s statistic and winning games Thus before you disregard this stat it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is Consider an example Bob hits a 2 out solo HR in the bottom of the first about 12 on your scale He does the same thing again in the fourth with the score tied for another 14 And again in the seventh with the score tied for another 22 And finally in the ninth to win the game by a score of 7 6 for a value of 0 5 Bob hit 4 solo HR in 4 plate appearances and was credited by your method with 12 14 22 5 98 But what does that mean Was Bob 98 responsible for the win Certainly not the defense is always 50 responsible if you include pitching in that and Bob wasn t pitching In fact Bob was only 4 7 of the offense which is a lot but not even close to 100 Furthermore what about the other 3 team runs Say they all came on solo HR by Fred then Fred was hitting HR to tie up the game which are just as valuable as HR to take the lead see Lindsey and Fred will himself have accrued a good 4 rating or so So Fred and Bob combined have amassed 138 of a win IN ONE GAME There s clearly a problem here The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has First we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game Second remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning That is a player who gets an out gets a negative probability in most cases Thus I m not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game Sometimes they will add up to more then one sometime less than one Also the pitchers bad performances giving up 6 runs may have given them a large negative percentage for that game Also any batter that pulled an 0 4 night would give large negatives Greg thinking about the right things but his intuition is off the mark Closers are enormously important The total number of runs value is outweighed by when they come or are prevented from comming The doubling which Greg allows is not enough In another article I proposed a test of this We can predict a team s won lost record quite accurately by looking at how many runs total they score and allow without regard to when those runs score in the game If late runs are really more important than early runs then looking only at late runs should lead to a better predictor right No but really only because you have a smaller sample size I would think however that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score in the last inning And realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation not a blow out It is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning Look a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games On the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win The offence has many more outs to do something about But I am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either If I am down 8 runs in the ninth it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth Here s another thought experiment apply this method to basketball What you find is that points scored in the first half of the game have almost exactly no value because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play Furthermore the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with no time on the clock gets a 1 0 for the game while the star forward who scored 27 points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero Does this make sense No but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made Look if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball And do not forget that somebody elses missed shots turnovers fouls bad defense etc caused a negative chance that the team would win From reading all of the discussion on this statistic I feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda At first look this statistic valadates clutchness But it really does not Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down I ve never seen convincing proof that this really happens So if you assume there is no clutchness then that means that except for a lot of noice this statistic has a positive association to player performance There is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness Certainly we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example We may find for instance that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15 on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5 I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses How do we evaluate relief pitchers Say John and Sam have the exact same pitching statistics runs earned runs K s BB s etc Both had exceptional numbers John however only pitched in closer situations while Sam was a Mop up man Who was more valuble to their team Probably John Who was the better pitcher They were probably about the same Brian Smith', 'From Douglas Fowler Subject ATAS N L games 8 2 8 5 standings of all Article I D usenet 1pqf84 caf Organization Case

of a dramatic four game series One Friday one Saturday and a good old Sunday doubleheader What could be better declared Ernie Banks Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging It s pitching it s always been pitching that we ve lacked announced Ryne Sandberg If we can get by Brewer then beat Carlton Alexander or Bunning preferrably 2 of the last three we ll know we might be able to win Lord I hope we pull it off The Phils scored once in the top of the first Richie Ashburn singled Pete Rose followed with a hit sending Ashburn around second Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third Rose went to second on the play Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center moving Pete Rose to third Schmidt was walked the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130 150 walks this year Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well and he lashed a double into a gap in right center Cool Papa Bell s speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from scoring Nellie Fox was walked and Bob Boone grounded out to second ending the threat Teams are starting to realize that you don t have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti and that is lowering their run total It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first and it s a credit to the Phillies that they ve been able to sustain their pace The picthers have slumped at times So came the analysis from Frank Chance The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit Thomas grounder moved him to second and after Sandberg made out Billy Williams singled home a run In the sixth Ron Santo launched a two run homer to make it 3 1 Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to third Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to hit Allen doubled to right but luckily for the Cubs Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third Lance Parrish hitting for Boone was walked and Bruce Sutter entered Larry Bowa grounded into a 1 2 3 double play but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch hitter Desiring a strikeout since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch running at third Chance brought in Lee Smith who induced a pop up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder ending the inning The Cubs took the win 3 2 moving a game behind the Phillies Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3 Finger Brown Saturday To get another righthander in the lineup Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played third Unfortunately Brown allowed six doubles and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Lefty Madlock batting sixth had knocked two doubles of his own driving home four runs Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs and Cuyler added another and the score was 8 6 Cubs after six innings The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth as the Cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11 7 triumph Sunday s twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point including a rare outside the park home run in the second game off Robin Roberts Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest 4 2 but the Cubs captured the second one 5 4 with Waddell gaining the win Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save though he allowed one run in the eighth The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co leaders and would conclude their series with the Expos on Monday Montreal at St Louis August 3 6 3 way tie for 1st Dennis Martinez is on a roll and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday The Expos have a wide variety of hitters and while they aren t among the all time greats they are getting the job done After winning their first first two games they suddenly found themselves only 2 1 2 games out of first in this wacky season Martinez triumphed 5 3 on Friday and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3 2 Saturday However the Cardinals refused to give up winning 6 2 on Sunday The Cards captured Monday s game too as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve Rogers 3 2 We re really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed remarked Lou Brock I don t see why we can t win this division The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them Two thirds of the way through the season there is a 3 way tie for first New York at Pittsburgh August 3 6 3 straight 3 2 wins for Bucs now 2 back but in 4th When your team is in a slump like we are the worst thing is to play in a pitcher s park like this spoke Gil Hodges before the series Keith Hernandez added that their defense takes away quite a few runs per year and it must be giving them an extra 6 7 wins The Pirates have made only 26 errors all season 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers Error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive All Time teams Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5 2 Friday and Candelaria outshone Seaver 3 2 Saturday in a game featuring some outstanding defense When Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6 hit the Mets in another 3 2 win Sunday the Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the 500 mark They had been unable to several times in the past month Bert Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game Both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two run blast by Ralph Kiner for the Pirates The Mets Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco working his second inning after Mookie Wilson pinch ran for Gary Carter at second With one out and a runner on first Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch hit The Pirates countered with Kent Tekulve placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter Tekulve induced a groundout forcing Strawberry at second He slid hard into Honus Wagner preventing the Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon Tekulve allowed a hit but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right field line ending the inning Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers who entered to pitch the eighth and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep center running through the stop sign at third to score an inside the park homer to win The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3 2 wins and had moved to within 2 games of first place with seven weeks to go San Francisco at Boswaukta August 3 5 Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule as the Giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldn t tire In fact reported manager John McGraw once this rough part of the schedule is over maybe as early as this coming week we may shift to a 4 man rotation again for a little while Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday beating Lew Burdette and the Braves 4 1 Willie Mays had all four r b i s on 3 hits Rick Reuschel faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest The Braves park had been a homer haven but this took the cake as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16 13 Willie Mays had three homers Willie McCovey Eddie Matthews and Don Baylor had two and Hank Aaron Ernie Lombardi Biz Mackey and Mel Ott had one each The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday s doubleheader putting them on a pace for 223 which would be 4 short of the National League record They were still a tad behind the 61 Yankees pace They had allowed over 120 though Vida Blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth He allowed only a run in the sixth but faltered in the seventh Joe McGinnity earned the save In the doubleheader the Braves Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the Braves won 4 3 The Giants took the second game however by a 6 2 score The homer by Aaron was a magical 150 by the Braves however they fell to three game below 500 making a comeback extremely unlikely San Diego at Cincinnati Aug 3 5 Randy Jones faced Ewell Blackwell in the first of this 3 game series and the Padres felt rather good With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game the trade looked even better McGriff s batting average was even rising Of course the bench was very poor and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the outfield but these were minor problems since the pitching was holding up Jones pitched a good game Friday and won 6 3 McGriff launched two home runs Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray Narleski Saturday 5 4 was the final score Tom Candiotti battled Satchel Paige to a 3 3 tie through eight innings before departing The game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth Paige had departed after 10 and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning Tom Browning was working his second scoreless inning when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and Joe Gordon was pitched around Thurm Munson doubled both runners home and the Padres gamed a 5 3 win The three game sweep had pulled the Giants into a tie with the Reds Though the Reds denied it the highly emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them Brookangeles at Houston August 3 5 Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the Astrodome The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in the first game opposite Don Drysdale Normally Drysdale remarked I would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them I can t afford to with this team though we have to get our own runners going we can t afford to let the Astros beat us He then winked and said Well maybe Davis will get decked once The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six is primarily why he would be decked but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season The hitting on this team is a little better but the power is all doubles and triples Still Carl Furillo is the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend as he threw two runners out trying for inside the park homers For those unaware of the nastness of the Astros park they have a 23 foot high gray wall all around the outfield balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs The foul poles are 355 feet from home plate but the alleys are 400 feet away with center field at 420 feet It s as if some three year old threw a tantrum and told his playmates If I can t hit home runs nobody will hit home runs remarked Roy Campanella The Dodgers stole five bases Friday but the Astros decided to revitalize the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before for tonight anyway Davis Jim Wynn and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings according to the manager After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the Baltimore chop Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch He responded with a two run double but Wynn playing first for Davis popped up and the Astros didn t score any more in that inning They did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3 2 deficit and the Astros wound up winning 6 4 They threatened to do even better the next game as Tommy John would be their opponent Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A M before the game I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop he explained How can we do that Pee Wee Reese wondered They re going to be beating the ball down so we ve got to be ready to throw on the run Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt but I want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws We ll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time The plan almost worked Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight innings but the Astros got three two of them scored when Bill Doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third 3 2 Astros was the final with Dave Smith earning another save The Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday as Nolan Ryan walked five three of whom scored in a 4 1 Dodger win Fernando Valenzuela lost the second game 4 2 to Don Sutton however as the Dodgers thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough We re mostly a power team remarked Ron Cey Jackie and when he plays Maury Wills are our only real speed demons though a couple other plays can do it now and then We re sunk in a place like the Astrodome I guess that s why they re so successful there Indeed it seems that basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome The Stros swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts giving them 230 on the

things turned out The Orioles Red Sox and Yankees all disappeared The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the expected pace The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half The Rangers predictably took a dive That shouldn t have surprised anybody Meanwhile as predicted the Mariners dropped behind the Angels and Royals They clearly didn t deserve the 22 33 record in June The White Sox and A s upped their game a bit while the Twins dropped off a little But for the most part things were as expected Okay so there were a few blatant errors But for a predictive calculation I thought this did pretty well From Tue Mar 31 16 36 34 1992 1 The Braves insert Kent Mercker into the starting rotation sometime this year 1992 Bielecki is traded or released Lei brandt becomes the fifth starter and the best bullpen in baseball has Pena Berenguer Stanton Wohlers Freeman and Pete Smith who spot starts as well Hm Pete Smith made the rotation instead of Mercker And Bielecki wasn t released until the end of the year I won t comment on the bullpen Jeff Reardon 2 Blauser wins the starting shortstop job outright by the end of May Bream goes on the DL and Klesko goes on a nice hitting honeymoon a la Gregg Jefferies in 1988 platooning with Hunter Mitchell wins the center field job a bit later All Star break and Nixon stays on as a valuable pinch runner Lonnie is released unless the Braves find a taker in a trade Right on Blauser Wrong on Bream and Mitchell A bit early on Lonnie as with Bielecki Didn t pick Sanders Did anybody 3 Managers to be fired this year 1992 in chronological order Fregosi Showalter Valentine Riddoch Three of them went right Showalter is still around and likely to stick it seems From Tue Mar 31 17 04 22 1992 1 Bonds gets traded from Bucs for some young talent Nope They won the division and so kept him for a shot at the playoffs 2 Mets win division Well they didn t finish last 3 Atlanta repeats in the West Got that one right 4 Yankees surprise everyone but finish second behind Toronto Nope 5 Dwight Gooden wins 20 but is surpassed by Saberhagen who wins 22 I guess this is why you picked the Mets to win huh 6 Roger Clemens is injured early in the season Tsk Tsk Not nice to predict something like this 7 Strawberry fails to hit even 20 home runs and is often injured 8 Due to 7 Dodgers drop out of race You got that right And my response From tedward Tue Mar 31 17 57 42 1992 Hmph Can tell you are a Mets fan Do you mind if I make some counter predictions against yours They follow 2 Mets come in third behind Pittsburgh and Montreal Okay so the Mets finished fifth But I got the Pirates and Expos right 4 The Yankees offense and pitching flounders dropping them to fourth place in the AL East Boston wins 95 games the division the pennant and the World Series First half Dead on Second half Ummm I m a Sox fan go easy on me 5 Dwight Gooden rushes his comeback gets blown out and goes on the DL from May through mid July Saberhagen runs a 500 record WFAN criticizes the Mets for giving away that great talent Jefferies who has a solid year in KC So I got my predictions for Gooden and Saberhagen reversed I was at least close and was right about Jefferies Though I don t know HAS WFAN criticized the Jefferies trade 6 Roger Clemens wins another CY as well as 20 games Close No cigar In article Amit Likhyani writes Excerpts from netnews rec sport baseball 1 Apr 92 Re NL East Smiley trade s 591 OPS Projected for 1992 HoJo 792 I will streak naked down Forbes avenue if HoJo does not muster more than a 792 OPS Something is wrong with that projection Some predictions need no introduction From Mon Apr 13 02 09 15 1992 From Do you care to put your prediction down for posterity You predict Mark Grace will get 90 RBIs I say you are out of your mind That is almost impossible for a 10 HR type guy batting behind Dawson Who kills most of the rallies he doesn t finish Why do you say that Mark has driven in 82 90 and 79 89 Last year Mark was batting second primarily and it was his worse year average wise Since he is batting either 3rd or 5th this year I predict he will be back up to his previous standards I think he will be better 90 rbi s is not that much of a stretch Sometimes us statheads get lucky Grace didn t hit behind Dawson the entire season but he also finished with only 79 RBIs From Tue May 19 22 09 06 1992 The most ballsy prediction ever Mark McGwire will hit 61 or more HRs this year Nope He slowed down and the injury finished him off Didn t even reach 50 But a ballsy prediction nonetheless From Thu May 21 16 42 21 1992 1 Baltimore will not fade They will not win the division this year but they will finish within five games I find the prospect of two Orioles winning 20 each easier to comprehend than that of two Sox No offense I think their pitching is about as good as the division has to offer The Orioles finished seven games out None of them won 20 though Mussina might have had a chance with better relief and more starts 2 Nobody else in the division is worth a darn They all finish a minimum of fifteen games out the Tribe 30 That s another reason to watch Baltimore this year and next they won t waste many of those games against the rest of the division Except for the Brewers who you probably forgot you were right The rest of the division was thoroughly mediocre The Yankees and Indians led with 76 wins the Red Sox trailed with 73 wins None were horrible but four were five or more games below 500 From David Johnson Date Thu 6 Aug 1992 15 47 30 GMT Right That was me I never said the Jays were a cinch to clinch it but I said that Milwaukee will be more of a threat than Baltimore I do think that Toronto should win it but after 87 I don t consider anything a cinch unless you have something like a 4 game lead with 3 games to go I do think that the Jays have the best talented team in the AL East and if we had a good or even average manager we might have a bigger lead right now I also think that the Orioles will not play much better than 500 baseball for the rest of the season You win From Thu Nov 14 14 33 45 1991 In article you write 7 Indians the first and only 0 162 season ever Prediction The Cleveland indians will win 70 or more games next year You were right From Fri Sep 13 01 15 52 1991 1 Jose Rijo will win the 1992 Cy Young award IF he is healthy enough to go at least 210 IP Who would have thought he would try to steal a base Why risk such an injury He had 211 IP but didn t win the Cy Young Maddux surprised all 2 The Orioles will win 88 games in at least 3 of the next 6 years probably the last 3 and their pitching staff will have a team ERA among the best 4 in the AL in at least 3 of the next 6 years but not necessarily all the same years as they win 88 This one will take a long time to verify I don t think I want to wait that long But they won 89 games last year and they were fifth in the league in ERA Not a bad start 4 Ben McDonald will not challenge for an ERA title in the next 2 years nor will he have 18 victories either year By challenge I mean FINISH among the leaders being among the leaders BEFORE the season is done doesn t count He will probably never be the pitcher he was hyped to be but is still a decent starter to have Looks like it He wasn t bad last year just too consistent to be an ace So far this year looks like more of the same 5 The Phillies will give up many fewer walks if when they get rid of their bullpen coach Ryan I am not predicting when or whether they will get rid of him and you will have to give the team a little bit of time to adjust before seeing the radical change They would have a fine pitching staff if they would just steal Ray Miller away from Pittsburg The White Sox seem to have the same problem but not as bad I honestly can t say Did they get rid of him Their BB totals were down last year 7 Ricky Jordan will have 90 rbi IF he starts 145 games hitting in the 3 or 4 or 5 spot in any lineup or the 6 spot in a lineup with very good OBP in the 4 5 hitters This applies for each of the next 3 years I just don t think he s that good 12 Billy Ripken will never again hit over 240 with 400 AB So far so good I m definitely not waiting to check this one From Fri Sep 13 12 38 08 1991 No matter what Lou Gorman and his scouts say Paul Quantrill will never ever be an adequate major league starter Never I have never seen a starting pitcher who can only strike out 3 per 9 innings at AAA be successful in the majors Current plans seem to be to use Quantrill in long relief He has a rubber arm and unusual delivery He might be decent in that role From Sat Sep 14 01 51 28 1991 M V P 92 A L Frank Thomas N L Hal Morris Division Winners 92 A L East Baltimore Orioles A L West Chicago White Sox A L Pennant Chicago White Sox N L East St Louis Cardinals N L West Cincinatti Reds N L Pennant Cincinatti Reds W S Champion Cincinatti Reds Wrong on all of the above Hal Morris And my favorites From tedward Sun Oct 20 23 52 57 1991 Belle will not walk as many as 50 times in 1992 Belle will hit more HR than he has walks in 1992 Belle hit 34 HR last year walking 52 times but five of those were intentional Okay so I exaggerate But I might have been right From Tue Mar 31 15 25 28 1992 Are the O s going to sign Cal of is Eli s wallet welded shut outgoing money only wide open for incoming cash 8 My prediction which you may make note of Valentine is that Eli Jacobs will defer any serious negotiations on Cal Ripken s contract until the 92 season is over Eli will give Cal every opportunity to have his stats tumble a bit from last year s pace before coming forth with an offer Despite claims that was designed to Cal s strength my feeling is that the 411 foot left center canyon will cut down on Cal s power stats After all it s hard to credibly to offer 3 4 million year to an All Star game MVP AL MVP Gold Glove shortstop baseball deity but it d be a lot easier to offer a similar salary to an obviously declining but above average shortstop who had a career year one full season ago Of course if Cal does match his 91 numbers then Eli is going to be faced with a rather huge and expensive problem How much did Cal sign for When did he sign If I remember correctly he got a rather hefty contract despite a weak season And finally From Thu Sep 12 10 35 58 1991 Generally because of expansion in 1993 there will be a lot of mediocre talent hanging around Much of it will not make it as the expansion teams look for younger talent around which to build their teams My specific predictions As of April 7 1993 Jim Acker and Cory Snider will be selling aluminum siding Snyder is still in SF Acker is gone Neither Charlie Kerfeld nor Vance Lovelace presently in Tiger AA but formerly big leaguers will be playing professional ball They aren t in the majors Nor will Dave Rozema who says he s keeping in shape with a hope for another shot with expansion Never heard of him Shawn Hare and Jody Hurst will be in the major leagues They are outfielders in the Tiger minor league system I don t think they are in the majors Ron Hassey will be a minor league manager with the Yankees Dunno what happened to him It will be bye bye for Balboni If he s still around he s stuck in the minors Bo Jackson will _not_ be a starter Hm With Raines out Bo looks to get a lot of PT Gary Huckaby will have moved to Alaska permanently they re on the net and Dave Kirsch will return to Canada to live Hm Thanks for listening Valentine']"

good any more Article I D rwing 2073 Distribution na Organization Totally Unorganized Lines 202 In article Brad Templeton writes In article Timothy C May writes Getting the court order to reveal the key also makes decipherable all past conversations which may be on tape or disk or whatver as I understand the proposal I could be wrong but I ve seen no mention of session keys being the escrowed entities True in theory In practice The technology of cellular phones will probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key If the frequency path depends on they key as I understand it to it could be made effectively impossible to record I am not an expert in the cryptography science but some basic things seem evident to me things which this Clinton Clipper do not address The all pertain to opportunites for abuse and conclusions based on what I have seen the membership of this group except for two notable persons agree to If anything bad is possible by the government in theory it almost always ends up happening in fact So the key is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE Question authority and remember power DOES corrupt I think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL be expanded to include other data forms such as data transfer and stored data and as such should be treated as if it were expanded or such expansion will be almost impossible to stop using Clipper as a precident There was a hint of that in the proposal remember That said please bear with me I am not very articulate so I take more words to say what others could say much more briefly Thank you Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access The telco isn t supposed to give that without a warrant That s the rule today As I suggested this is NOW The hint is in the proposal that this or similar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions such as data transfer data files and such largely dependent on how this thing is accepted or flies I think one would be wise to treat this in the manner one would when not if it gets expanded to other areas than cellular phones I think this is guaranteed to happen if this proposal gets by Salami politics It has been and is used in several other areas it is certain to be used here Government is not going to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop whenever they want to Court order required has proven to be a rather flimsy guarantee If the case warrants they can always sieze the material and force one to give the key or sit in jail forever on periodically renewed contempt charges So it is not denying the justice system the information nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty or refuses to divulge the means to access the info this is not protected under the Fifth one can be forced to perform ACTS that would result in divulging incriminating evidence So blocking restrictions on private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement it does make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult Especially fishing expeditions without the target s knowlege Don t give up the right to be safe from that that should be non negotiable and Clinton and Co know it which is probably why they quietly developed this thing figuring if they get it this far they can ram it on through How come those consulted could be roughly described as us insiders They cannot quietely IMPLIMENT it though when they ban other schemes to ensure its exclusive use Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone Don t buy into it Has government really earned that kind of trust past or future To be secure and free one must keep government honest and the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE not unlikely or difficult But even so the evidence would not be admissible I think unless the judge so ordered I think that even interception of the crypttext without a warrant would be illegal Cops can t record today s plain cellular calls and then ask a judge Hey can we have permission to listen to those tapes can they So what One could use information gained by re use of the keys saved after the last case was finished or other means master key backdoor easily broken algorithm to find other evidence which given to a judge would authorize a tap which wouldn t have been possible otherwise This has been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past For local cops this might be workable to keep them honest but the Feds have a workaround somehow BET on it Does anyone really believe for example that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen in on scanning for keywords either easily defeated in realtime or via a master key I sure don t This whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use old fashioned police work to build a case In the past eavesdropping was rather easy with or without a court order I think the Law Enforcement community has become a bit spoiled and will resist changes that require them to revert to using old fashioned detective work I just find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much about civil and individual rights that puts people first The question is put people first to WHERE With the innards not being revealed how is one to be sure there DOESN T exist a master key for use by NSA etc so they can do their keyword scan etc on conversations they routinely monitor without a specific court order Remember the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY Bet on it And so far I have not heard about police telling people that they have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found What is to keep them from simply keeping the keys on file for next time After awhile they would have quite a collection Kept especially for folks they deem disruptive And if they get only one key that would reduce the search space a lot unless it is an RSA scheme Remember Nixon years Need for court orders really slowed them down didn t it And unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled fat chance I see one ending up being under say Treasury the other under Justice it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to a competitor s Clinton Clipper or descendent when this idea is expanded to be used for all non government encryption Enough bucks would get one the keys or the innards for this algorithm Perhaps not an important concern but given past government behavior and the other problems worse of course if the government then uses this Clinton Clipper to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption This is the main concern of most of us I think The camel s nose in the tent etc Yes that is a major concern but I think that they think they can win just by having 99 5 of the USA use this system They don t even have to care about the cautious 5 that s left They don t catch the really smart crooks anyway John Gotti who would have to be retarded not to realize he was likely to be wiretapped glibly chatted away on his tapped phone about murder plans That s why he s in jail now Hard to believe but true What will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption You can BET that if Clipper is accepted that will be next on the agenda It is even hinted at in the proposal read it carefully Expect the argumet well if you got nothing to hide Fine Then using that argument one should not object to video cameras being installed in every room of one s home Granted an exteme expansion of the idea but the principle holds Private stuff should remain private even from a govt fishing expedition And laws rules may change in the future as to safeguards When it comes to the Fed Government safeguards are pretty meaningless if they want to do get something Don t work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights or establish bad precidents please The price could be hell to pay later This scheme can succeed without laws forbidding more which people would fight a lot harder They like this enough that they are dropping the so called Digital Telephony proposal according to rumours However the meaning of that is complex since they still want to get at the crypttext on telco systems and that requires a bit of work People would fight laws forbidding more NOW but in say two years because we have this crisis situation which MUST be addressed by some drastic action just this added reasonable restriction will only bother those who have someting to hide etc Please don t buy into it If the Clinton Clipper is so very good why not make its algrithm public so many people can exchange ideas and examine it rather than a few isolated respected experts respected by whom for what Perhaps a certain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected experts this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was advocating if I recall How would anybody know that what the experts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper Chip if it is kept secret Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled version with a master key provision or features not present in the version subjected for study and evaluation by the experts And who chooses the expertes The government No conflict of interest there And isn t it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT have its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known I was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything you have except for the key s I recall ideas presented to this group are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret Another question since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not be used for government security they are regarding it as not real secure but good enough for common folk I think I would like to see a full description not a PR non statement of just what good enough means I think when saying how strong it is good enough really means not very The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not acceptable Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and Constitution which the people not the governments of those other countries often regard with envy what we have as rights they have as revokable privileges And if we expect to retain those rights and protections we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA have this thing to fight crime We have allready have our Bill of Rights pretty much torn to shreds We should not permit more weakining for yet another noble cause instead we should be trying to repair the damage Our crime problem may have a number of causes but too many rights and safeguards is not a signifigant one A broken court system and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having too many rights disregarding addressing the root causes for crime etc BTW those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton believe this I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed this thing It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights under the Constitution or Bill of Rights The last couple of decades have been a non stop series of end runs around the protections of the Constitution It has to stop Now is as

Distribution world Organization Georgetown University Lines 167 Here is a revised version of my summary which corrects some errors and provides some additional information and explanation THE CLIPPER CHIP A TECHNICAL SUMMARY Dorothy Denning Revised April 21 1993 INTRODUCTION On April 16 the President announced a new initiative that will bring together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement At the heart of the plan is a new tamper proof encryption chip called the Clipper Chip together with a split key approach to escrowing keys Two escrow agencies are used and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key CHIP CONTENTS The Clipper Chip contains a classified single key 64 bit block encryption algorithm called Skipjack The algorithm uses 80 bit keys compared with 56 for the DES and has 32 rounds of scrambling compared with 16 for the DES It supports all 4 DES modes of operation The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks and in Electronic Codebook ECB mode runs at 12 Mbits per second Each chip includes the following components the Skipjack encryption algorithm F an 80 bit family key that is common to all chips N a 30 bit serial number this length is subject to change U an 80 bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip The chips are programmed by Mykotronx Inc which calls them the MYK 78 The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc They are implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about 30 each in quantities of 10 000 or more The price should drop as the technology is shrunk to 8 micron ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP To see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the AT T telephone security device as it will be Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device After pushing a button to start a secure conversation my security device will negotiate an 80 bit session key K with the device at the other end This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip In general any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie Hellman public key distribution method Once the session key K is established the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M digitized voice The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values E M K the encrypted message stream and E E K U N F a law enforcement field which are transmitted over the telephone line The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N all encrypted under the family key F The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed The ciphertext E M K is decrypted by the receiver s device using the session key D E M K K M CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF Secure Compartmented Information Facility which is essentially a vault The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips About 300 chips are programmed during a single session The SCIF is located at Mykotronx At the beginning of a session a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault Agent 1 enters a secret random 80 bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret random 80 bit value S2 These random values serve as seeds to generate unit keys for a sequence of serial numbers Thus the unit keys are a function of 160 secret random bits where each agent knows only 80 To generate the unit key for a serial number N the 30 bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34 bit block to produce a 64 bit block N1 S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple encrypt N1 producing a 64 bit block R1 R1 E D E N1 S1 S2 S1 Similarly N is padded with two other 34 bit blocks to produce N2 and N3 and two additional 64 bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed R2 E D E N2 S1 S2 S1 R3 E D E N3 S1 S2 S1 R1 R2 and R3 are then concatenated together giving 192 bits The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2 The rest are discarded The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2 U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies As a sequence of values for U1 U2 and U are generated they are written onto three separate floppy disks The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1 The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values The third disk contains the unit keys U Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk Thus each agent walks away knowing an 80 bit seed and the 80 bit key parts However the agent does not know the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80 bit key parts The third disk is used to program the chips After the chips are programmed all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2 and the second two the escrow agents would take the disks back to the escrow agencies The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined but they will not be the NSA CIA FBI or any other law enforcement agency One or both may be independent from the government LAW ENFORCEMENT USE When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line Let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the Clipper Chip The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the family key F giving E K U N Documentation certifying that a tap has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is then sent e g via secure FAX to each of the key escrow agents who return e g also via secure FAX U1 and U2 U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce the unit key U and E K U is decrypted to get the session key K Finally the message stream is decrypted All this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder CAPSTONE THE NEXT GENERATION A successor to the Clipper Chip called Capstone by the government and MYK 80 by Mykotronx has already been developed It will include the Skipjack algorithm the Digital Signature Standard DSS the Secure Hash Algorithm SHA a method of key exchange a fast exponentiator and a randomizer A prototoype will be available for testing on April 22 and the chips are expected to be ready for delivery in June or July ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION NOTICE This article is based on information provided by NSA NIST

Press Secretary _________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 16 1993 STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals A state of the art microcircuit called the Clipper Chip has been developed by government engineers The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology It can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals A key escrow system will be established to ensure that the Clipper Chip is used to protect the privacy of law abiding Americans Each device containing the chip will have two unique 2 keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device When the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key escrow data bases that will be established by the Attorney General Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap The Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices In addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption s dual edge sword encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists We need the Clipper Chip and other approaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches like the key escrow system the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the National Information Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of American industry in the global marketplace and the need of U S companies to manufacture and export high technology products The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed 3 The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information This infrastructure of high speed networks information superhighways will transmit video images HDTV programming and huge data files as easily as today s telephone system transmits voice Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet The provisions of the President s directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available For additional details call Mat Heyman National Institute of Standards and Technology 301 975 2758 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION S TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE Q Does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations A No Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans Q Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device What would they have to do to decipher the message A They would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place They would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers The key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system Q Who will run the key escrow data banks A The two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities At this point the Department of Justice and the Administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data banks Q How strong is the security in the device How can I be sure how strong the security is A This system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities Q Whose decision was it to propose this product A The National Security Council the Justice Department the Commerce Department and other key agencies were involved in this decision This approach has been endorsed by the President the Vice President and appropriate Cabinet officials Q Who was consulted The Congress Industry A We have on going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative Q Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers A The government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers Product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them Q Who provides the Clipper Chip A Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance California and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers The programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future Q How do I buy one of these encryption devices A We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the Clipper Chip into their devices Q If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices A This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the Administration is developing The Administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done nor is the U S saying that every American as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product There is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or proposition Rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper Chip and similar encryption techniques Q What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton Administration s policy toward encryption will differ from that of the Bush Administration A It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public interest groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism Q Will the devices be exportable Will other devices that use the government hardware A Voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements Case by case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices The same is true for other encryption devices One of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to U S companies operating at home and abroad With this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case by case basis for U S companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad We plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products End included article Without prejudice UCC 1 207 Pat Myrto Seattle WA If all else fails try

Express Card Organization Stratus Computer Inc Lines 122 Distribution world NNTP Posting Host rocket sw stratus com In article Thomas Parsli writes If I would like to have a handgun i would have to get an gun licence from the police and to be a member of a gun club The police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes and or records of SERIOUS mental diseases Now if a got my licence I would have to be an active member of the gun club for 6 months BEFORE I could collect my gun So like what do you do during those six months to be active My town has a similar requirement and it s rather stupid Before you can buy a handgun you have to be an active member of a gun club Well how active can you be without a gun chief Most gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental disorders would be a very good thing IF it couldn t be abused by the government But every time this is proposed there is always some trapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase EVEN IF you are perfectly qualified to own a gun And we oppose this It s a little like getting a drivers licence isn t it You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to Since the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the US is around 50 times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun owners I d think twice before using this analogy Besides the problem is criminal use of guns not accidents There are about 500 000 criminal uses of guns in the US every year but only 1 400 accidents I don t think it s necessary to spend a lot of energy making sure a criminal CAN shoot a gun before he gets one Just like the check most gun owners feel positively about requiring safety courses IF they couldn t be abused by the government But they already have One state doesn t hold the courses another doesn t fund them a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence to those with political connections Is this fair Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes and mostly short time befor the crime And how many of them acquire these guns from legal retail outlets How many are borrowed stolen smuggled bought on the black market Use of knives It IS allowed to cary knifes in public but not in your belt or open You Americans think it s ok to have a gun but not to carry it open in public rigth Some states allow ONLY open carry Some allow ONLY concealed carry Some allow both Some allow both but require licenses for concealed carry All you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage over another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good then state legislators SOMEPLACE are doing exactly the wrong thing Which means that they really don t have any objective reasons for these laws other than their preferences a bad way to govern Scandinavians ARE aggressive We northeners are not as hot livered as southeners but when we decide to take action we DO Hot livered I LOVE that expression Here we say hot headed Individual vs masses Yes the individual is more important than the masses but only to some extent Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of all the others Typically the only criminals who can affect the rights of ALL the other people are criminals in government offices The rest of our criminals affect the rights of only one or a few people at a time and they do this during the commission of a crime POSSESSION of a gun by someone hurts NO ONE else It is when they do something violent with that gun that the crime occurs Of course it is a crime for a felon or ex felon to possess a gun but we don t feel it is right to treat common citizens who have lived good lives as if they were just pre felons waiting to commit crimes We shouldn t mix weapons and items that can serve as one I don t understand this sentence IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME But should it have to be like that Life isn t fair I shouldn t need a fire extinguisher either or flood and theft insurance or to lock the doors of my house and car But pining for a better world won t do anything to address what I have to do to live in this one Do you think it s wise to sell guns like candy some states do None of ours I m sure If you believe it s smart neccacery to have drivers licence WHY do you think it should be free to buy guns Frankly I m not sure I know what good a driver s license does anyone either The people who drive safely never use it and the people who drive drunk drive without it However a car is a good tool but not one that protects my right to life I rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel freely I m not a pacifist or anti gun I would defend my home loved ones and country but I don t view guns as neccities or toys I HAVE done army service and HAVE used a variaty of weapons but wouldn t want to have one for self defence or because they feel good The question is not whether or not you want to own guns personally It s whether or not you think that ALL people should be forced to do as you do I don t have any problem with someone who says they would never own a gun I do have a problem with someone who says I should be prevented from owning one too If you believe that I speak for my company OR write today for my special Investors Packet', 'From David Veal Subject Re My Gun is like my American Express Card Lines 128 Organization University of Tennessee Division of Continuing Education In article Thomas Parsli writes Abuse by the goverment This seems to be one of the main problems Any harder gun control would just be abused by the goverment Either some of you are a little paranoid no offence Mr Parsli I have to take exception at this There are verifiable previous examples of levels of U S governments abusing gun control restrictions I don t think it is paranoid to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused in thye future After so many times of getting burned any sane person will stop putting his hand on the stove OR you should get a new goverment You do have elections I d love to But as long as the politicians grab power to sell pork back to their constituents there s not a lot I can do It s silly to suggest that if there s anything we can t trust the government to do and therefore the government should be allowed to do it then we should change governments Down that road lies total government power I ve never been a fan of totalitarianism Guns n Criminals MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen This is very likely Known criminals can NOT buy weapons that s one of the points of gun control And because gun control are strict in WHOLE scandinavia and most of europe we dont have any PROBLEM with smuggled guns The North American Continent is not Europe no matter how many people would like it to be Drugs are very illegal and they re here For years Canada has crowed about its gun control If it is necessary to control guns over the whole continent then Canada should have always had comparable rates to the U S yet they still don t Unless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more magical than the Mexican border which is shorter and far more heavily patrolled then I really can t accept that argument Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one What I meant was that cars CAN kill but they are not GUNS No there are approximately 31 000 deaths due to guns in the U S two thirds of which are suicides Unfortunately I don t have suicide rates for Norway However this makes the per gun death rate about half the per car death rate The issue I hope I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem Guns are not a problem but the way they are used is and what are they for I think this discusion is interesting when you think of ex Jugoslavia They should all have weapons it s their rigth to have them and if they use them to kill other Innocent people the problem is humans not guns The problem s been humans since before we had stone axes The fct of the matter is simply this If nobody ever assaulted anybody whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally irrelevent Yet weapons are built I d suggest then that the murderous impulse in humanity pre dates weapons Anyway the Bosnians et al have been making an excellent attempt to kill each other for half a thousand years Taking away their guns even if we could would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality If 50 of ALL murders was done with axes would you impose some regulations on them or just say that they are ment to be used at trees and that the axe is not a problem it s the axer An example don t flame me just because not exactly 50 are killed by guns In the U S approximately 60 of murders are commited with firearms 50 with handguns 10 with non handguns The reason I say that guns per se are not the problem is that our non gun rate exceeds most of Europe s countries entire violent crime rate I don t really think we ve got more knives or fists In any case I think examples of gun control applied to the U S have been abkect failures just like drug prohibition and other forms of prohibition Until you deal with why people are doing what they are doing you won t solve your problem And if the problem is violent crime you shouldn t concentrate on the tools instead The vast majority of guns is never ever misused On the order of 99 5 over the entire lifetime of the gun This says to me that you can t make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect themselves Is this a good situation The situation is not good in that people fear for their lives But recall the scenes of the store owners during the last riots protecting their shops with guns Would it have been better they too lost their livelihoods Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles no it isn t However if that problem becomes a violent action then yes it can be appropriate Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition won t make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it You have to examine which problem you re referring to If you re discussing someone violently assaulting you then it is a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop Hopefully simply letting them know you re prepared to shoot them would be enough as it was with the above mentioned store owners If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals and their neighbor who have guns what do you think will happen I mean if everybody had a gun in USA 45 of Households have some form of firearm usually a long gun That accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans Firearm ownership is most likely among educated well off whites the group least likely to be involved in violent crime You may take that for what it s worth David Veal Univ of Tenn Div of Cont Education Info Services Group I still remember the way you laughed the day your pushed me down the elevator shaft I m beginning to

appear here So in the future if you re looking for something check there first and then ask here Instructions Short version for techies The site is godiva nectar cs cmu edu Place contributions into the directory usr0 anon pub firearms politics rkba The ftp commands get put mget or mput should work Give the command type binary to be sure files are transferred correctly Your files will be moved to the rkba directory To get a file use the commands get or mget I will maintain an index which you should get first to check if the file you want to read or write already is archived Long version for non techies In order for you to use this archive your computer must be on the Internet To connect to the archive site run the command ftp godiva nectar cs cmu edu If that doesn t work you cannot use this archive If the ftp command is successful you ll get this prompt asking you for a login Name godiva nectar cs cmu edu lvc Instead of lvc your initials will appear Answer this prompt with ftp Next you ll get this prompt asking your for your e mail address Guest login ok send e mail address as password I would enter You ll enter your own e mail address You ll get these lines or similar as output Remote system is UNIX Using binary mode to transfer files Next the command prompt is printed ftp If you do not get the line Using binary mode to transfer files Run the command type binary Now you re logged in to the archive machine There are many directories on this machine but the two you are concerned with are usr0 anon pub firearms politics rkba and usr0 anon pub firearms politics incoming There are subdirectories to the rkba directory those are discussed below When you login to the system your directory is usr0 anon To retreive files change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command cd usr0 anon pub firearms politics rkba or cd pub firearms politics rkba To submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with the command cd usr0 anon pub firearms politics incoming or cd pub firearms politics incoming Once you do this you ll get another ftp prompt asking you to enter another command To find the names of the existing files in the directory you are in run the command ls l This will produce something like total 6021 r r r 1 karl 6932 Jun 16 1992 DMN_Gratia_CCP r r r 1 karl 69149 Apr 5 19 20 INDEX r r r 1 karl 18965 Jun 16 1992 Knox_AW_lies r

and so on Each line corresponds to one file Reading right to left the fields are the file name the last modification date of the file the size of the file in bytes and some permission fields which you do not need to be concerned with To get a file run the command get followed by the name of the file you want for example get INDEX or get noduty After the file is transfered to your machine a message like this Transfer complete 19580 bytes received in 5 seconds 4 Kbytes s You can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive You can use the mget command to retreive multiple files If the file you want is in a subdirectory for example congress 103rd HR1025 you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first and then retrieve it cd congress 103rd get HR1025 Once you re finished you can log off with the command quit If you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little different First of all you should find out if the file already exists so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above and look it over to make sure you wouldn t repeat an entry The index will have a description of each of the files in the rkba directory For example File whitemanslaw White Man s Law by William R Tonso from the December 1985 Reason magazine Once you ve determined you won t be duplicating an entry login and change to the incoming directory command see above Once you are in the incoming directory use the command put file_name In this case put whitemanslaw Again there ll be a Transfer complete so many bytes transfered in so many seconds message Now your file is on the archive machine Another thing to watch out for is duplicate file names Be sure there isn t a file in the incoming directory that is called the same as the file you want to write If you use the same name you ll overwrite the previous file or you ll get an error message Your file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a file by the same name in the rkba directory Once your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for the INDEX file and I will add it to the file If you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute a file email the file to me and I ll take care of the rest If you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed so be sure to let me know first If you have any questions feel free to ask me Larry Cipriani Michael Phelps

general however systems connected to the net fall in one of three categories Internet Usenet or BITNET Electronic mail may be sent between these networks and other resources available on one of these networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to special servers The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of several mechanisms with mostly transparent connections between them One mechanism is the mailing list in which mail is sent to a central distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list In addition to the general lists for space called SPACE Digest for Internet users and SPACE on BITNET there are a number of more specialized mailing lists described below A second mechanism is Usenet netnews This is somewhat like a bulletin board operating on each system which is a part of the net Netnews separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a group name The groups dealing most closely with space topics are called sci space news sci space sci space shuttle sci astro and talk politics space Contributors post submissions called articles in netnews terminology on their local machine which sends it to other nearby machines Similarly articles sent from nearby machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems so that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was posted Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci space group into Internet and BITNET mailing lists and vice versa the other Usenet groups are not accessible as mailing lists If you can receive netnews its more flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make it the preferred option MAILING

injuries First and foremost of importance if you experience pain at all then you absolutely need to go see a doctor As soon as you possibly can The difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery and a long drawn out ordeal GO SEE A DOCTOR Now your garden variety doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury Generally any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in these kinds of problems DON T WAIT THOUGH GO SEE A DOCTOR The remainder of this information is paraphrased without permission from a wonderful report by New Zealand s Department of Labour Occupational Safety and Health Service Occupational Overuse Syndrome Treatment and Rehabilitation A Practitioner s Guide First a glossary or fancy names for how you shouldn t have your hands note you re likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors RSI Repetitive Strain Injury a general term for many kinds of injuries OOS Occupational Overuse Syndrome synonym for RSI CTD Cumulative Trauma Disorder another synonym for RSI WRULD Work Related Upper Limb Disorders yet another synonym for RSI CTS Carpal Tunnel Syndrome see below Hyperextension Marked bending at a joint Pronation Turning the palm down Wrist extension Bending the wrist up Supination Turning the palm up Wrist flexion Bending the wrist down Pinch grip The grip used for a pencil Ulnar deviation Bending the wrist towards the little finger Power grip The grip used for a hammer Radial Deviation Bending the wrist toward the thumb Abduction Moving away from the body Overspanning Opening the fingers out wide Now then problems come in two main types Local conditions and diffuse conditions Local problems are what you d expect specific muscles tendons tendon sheaths nerves etc being inflamed or otherwise hurt Diffuse conditions often mistaken for local problems can involve muscle discomfort pain burning and or tingling with identifiable areas of tenderness in muscles although they re not necessarily the problem Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur Here s the theory Normally your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which pass among the muscle fibers When you tense a muscle you restrict the blood flow By the time you re exerting 50 of your full power you re completely restricting your blood flow Without fresh blood your muscles use stored energy until they run out then they switch to anaerobic without oxygen metabolism which generates nasty by products like lactic acid which cause pain Once one muscle hurts all its neighbors tense up perhaps to relieve the load This makes sense for your normal sort of injury but it only makes things worse with repetitive motion More tension means less blood flow and the cycle continues Another by product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from your nerves They need blood too Anyway when you re typing too much you re never really giving a change for the blood to get back where it belongs because your muscles never relax enough to let the blood through Stress poor posture and poor ergonomics only make things worse Specific injuries you may have heard of note most injuries come in two flavors acute and chronic Acute injuries are severely painful and noticable Chronic conditions have less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real Tenosynovitis an inflamation of the tendon sheath Chronic tenosynovitis occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent not enough to cause acute inflamation but enough to exceed the tendon sheath s ability to lubricate the tendon As a result the tendon sheath thickens gets inflamed and you ve got your problem Tendonitis an inflammation of a tendon Repeated tensing of a tendon can cause inflamation Eventually the fibers of the tendon start separating and can even break leaving behind debris which induces more friction more swelling and more pain Sub acute tendonitis is more common which entails a dull ache over the wrist and forearm some tenderness and it gets worse with repetitive activity Carpal Tunnel Syndrome the nerves that run through your wrist into your fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them Symptoms include feeling pins and needles tingling numbness and even loss of sensation CTS is often confused for a diffuse condition Adverse Mechanical Tension also known as neural tension this is where the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere AMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS disorders It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy Others for just about every part of your body there s a fancy name for a way to injure it By now you should be getting an idea of how OOS conditions occur and why Just be careful many inexperienced doctors misdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome when in reality you may have a completely different problem Always get a second opinion before somebody does something drastic to you like surgery 4 Typing posture ergonomics prevention treatment The most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce tension in the muscles and tendons This requires learning how to relax If you re under a load of stress this is doubly important Tune out the world and breath deep and regular Relaxing should become a guiding principle in your work every three minutes take a three second break EVERY THREE MINUTES TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK Really do it every three minutes It s also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings calm down and relax If you can t sleep you really need to focus on this Rest sleep and relaxation are really a big deal There are all kinds of other treatments of course Drugs can reduce inflamation and pain Custom molded splints can forcefully prevent bad posture Surgery can fix some problems Exercise can help strengthen your muscles Regular stretching can help prevent injury Good posture and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension Ice or hot cold contrast baths also reduce swelling Only your doctor can say what s best for you Posture here are some basic guidelines I so liked the way this was written in the New Zealand book that I m lifting it almost verbatim from Appendix 10 dwallach Let your shoulders relax Let your elbows swing free Keep your wrists straight Pull your chin in to look down don t flop your head forward Keep the hollow in the base of your spine Try leaning back in the chair Don t slouch or slump forward Alter your posture from time to time Every 20 minutes get up and bend your spine backward Set the seat height first Your feet should be flat on the floor There should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees and your thighs should not slope too much Now draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable to work at If you are short this may be impossible The beest remedy is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a footrest Now adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space between the backrest and the seat pan The backrest should support you in the hollow of your back so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this area If you operate a keyboard you will be able to spend more time leaning back so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest if available Now I diverge a little from the text A good chair makes a big difference If you don t like your chair go find a better one You really want adjustments for height back angle back height and maybe even seat tilt Most arm rests seem to get in the way although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm rests which you can also rotate out of the way You should find a good store and play with all these chairs pick one that s right for you In the San Francisco Bay Area I highly recommend Just Chairs The name says it all Keyboard drawers wrist pads and keyboard replacements There is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right For some people wrist pads seem to work wonders However with good posture you shouldn t be resting your wrists on anything you would prefer your keyboard to be right there If you drop your arms at your side and then lift your hands up at the elbow you want your keyboard under your hands when your elbows are at about 90 degrees Of course you want to avoid pronation wrist extension and ulnar deviation at all costs Wrist pads may or may not help at this You should get somebody else to come and look at how you work how you sit how you type and how you relax It s often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or deviated hands Some argue that the normal flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly designed A number of replacements are available on the market today Check out the accompanying typing injury faq keyboards for much detail 5 Requests for more info Clearly the above information is incomplete The typing injury archive is incomplete There s always more information out there If you d like to submit something please send me mail and I ll gladly throw it in If you d like to maintain a list of products or vendors that would be wonderful I d love somebody to make a list of chair desk vendors I d love somebody to

donation for the Mednews OCR Scanner Fund We have reached our goal A Hewlett Packard Scanjet IIp was purchased this week Thank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received John Sorenson Carol Sigelman Carla Moore Barbara Moose Judith Schrier Again thank you to all who gave I have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to review the product Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems It runs under Windows 3 1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett Packard Scanners When initially bringing up the software it lets you select several options 1 text graphics 2 input source ie scanner fax file disk file 3 automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which parts of the document I would like scanned and in what order Once an image is scanned you can bring up the Pop Up image verification The software gives you two errors at this point Blue which are words that were converted reliability but do not match anything in the built in dictionary Yellow shade which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn t think it converted correctly at all I have found that the software should give itself more credit It is usually correct instead of wrong If a word is shaded blue you can add it to your personal dictionary The only problem is the personal dictionary will only handle about 200 words I find this to be very limited considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary After a document is converted you can save it in a multitude of word processor formats Also any images that were captured can be stored in a seperate TIFF or PCX file format I was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files I use HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 1 Volume 6 Number 10 April 20 1993 an Intel Satisfaxtion card which stores incoming faxs in a PCX DCX format While most of my faxes were received in standard mode 200x100 dpi the accuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent Overall a very impressive product The only fault I could find is the limitations of the size of the user dictionary 200 specialized words is just too small

Infectious Diseases SOURCE MMWR 42 14 DATE Apr 16 1993 Introduction Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem 1 infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the United States Since the early 1970s the U S public health system has been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes e g Escherichia coli O157 H7 hepatitis C virus human immunodeficiency virus Legionnaires disease Lyme disease and toxic shock syndrome The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control such as cholera malaria and tuberculosis TB have increased in many areas Furthermore control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea malaria pneumococcal disease salmonellosis shigellosis TB and staphylococcal infections 2 Emerging infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons those in institutional settings e g hospitals and child day care centers and minority and underserved populations The substantial economic burden of emerging infections on the U S health care system could be reduced by more effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs 3 This issue of MMWR introduces a new series Emerging Infectious Diseases Future articles will address these diseases as well as surveillance control and prevention efforts by health care providers and public health officials This first article updates the ongoing investigation of an outbreak of E coli O157 H7 in the western United States 4 References 1 Burnet M Natural history of infectious disease Cambridge England Cambridge University Press 1963 2 Kunin CM

associated deaths occurred in four states Washington Idaho California and Nevada This report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation 1 that identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from one restaurant chain Washington On January 13 1993 a physician reported to the Washington Department of Health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS and an increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea During January 16 17 a case control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or postdiarrheal HUS identified with age

outbreak report from Washington the Division of Health Idaho Department of Health and Welfare identified 14 persons with culture confirmed E coli O157 H7 infection with illness onset dates from December 11 1992 through February 16 1993 Figure 2A Four persons were hospitalized one developed HUS During the week preceding illness onset 13 93 had eaten at a chain A restaurant California In late December the San Diego County Department of Health Services was notified of a child with E coli O157 H7 infection who subsequently died Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with E coli O157 H7 infections or HUS from mid November through mid January 1993 Four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and HICNet Medical Newsletter Page

visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January 1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E coli O157 H7 with onset from November 15 1992 through January 31 1993 Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition Figure

Chain B was not statistically associated with illness Nevada On January 22 after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten at a local chain A restaurant the Clark County Las Vegas Health District issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea contact the health department A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured or any diarrheal illness with a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E coli O157 H7 with onset from December 1 1992 through February 7 1993 Because local laboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey SMAC medium to screen stools for E coli O157 H7 this organism was not identified in any patient After SMAC medium was distributed the outbreak strain was detected in the stool

Enteric Diseases Br Div of Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases National Center for Infectious Diseases CDC Editorial Note E coli O157 H7 is a pathogenic gram negative bacterium first identified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers 2 This pathogen has since emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS the most common cause of acute renal failure in children Outbreak investigations have linked most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef although other food vehicles including roast beef raw milk and apple cider also have been implicated 3 Preliminary data from a CDC 2 year nationwide multicenter study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E coli O157 H7 that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 participating hospitals and was isolated from 7 8 of all bloody stools a higher rate than for any other pathogen Infection with E coli O157 H7 often is not recognized because most clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 7 Volume 6 Number 10 April 20 1993 SMAC medium and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses associated with infection 4 The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea often bloody and abdominal cramps fever is infrequent Younger age groups and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and complications Illness usually resolves after 6 8 days but 2 7 of patients develop HUS which is characterized by hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia renal failure and a death rate of 3 5 This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community outbreaks of E coli O157 H7 in the absence of routine surveillance Despite the magnitude of this outbreak the problem may not have been recognized in three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington 1 Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E coli O157 H7 using SMAC agar 5 When infections with E coli O157 H7 are identified they should be reported to local health departments for further evaluation and if necessary public health action to prevent further cases E coli O157 H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle and can contaminate meat during slaughter CDC is collaborating with the U S Department of Agriculture s Food Safety Inspection Service to identify critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce the likelihood of pathogens such as E coli O157 H7 entering the meat supply Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with pathogens and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens from the surface of the meat to the interior ground beef is likely to be internally contaminated The optimal food protection practice is to cook ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink and the juices are clear In this outbreak undercooking of hamburger patties likely played an important role The Food and Drug Administration FDA has issued interim recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to 155 F 86 1 C FDA personal communication 1993 Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of outbreaks The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections caused by E coli O157 H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E coli O157 H7 References 1 CDC Preliminary report

Tobacco Among Adults United States 1991 SOURCE MMWR 42 14 DATE Apr 16 1993 Consumption of moist snuff and other smokeless tobacco products in the United States almost tripled from 1972 through 1991 1 Long term use of smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of oral cancer 2 the incidence of which could increase if young persons who currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently 1 To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products CDC s 1991 National Health Interview Survey Health Promotion and Disease Prevention supplement NHIS HPDP collected information on snuff and chewing tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U S civilian noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years This report summarizes findings from this survey The 1991 NHIS HPDP supplement asked Have you used snuff at least 20 times in your entire life and Do you use snuff now Similar questions were asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking Current users of smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco use at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the time of the interview former users were defined as those who reported having used snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the time of the interview Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and former users Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at least 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as those who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not smoking now Ever smokers included current and former smokers Data on smokeless tobacco use were available for 43 732 persons aged greater than or equal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide national estimates Confidence intervals CIs were calculated by using standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis SUDAAN 3 In 1991 an estimated 5 3 million 2 9 U S adults were current users of smokeless tobacco including 4 8 million 5 6 men and 533 000 0 6 women For all categories of comparison the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was substantially higher among men For men the prevalence of use was highest among those aged 18 24 years Table 1 for women the prevalence was highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years The prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians Alaskan Natives and whites the prevalence among women was highest among American Indians Alaskan Natives and blacks Among both men and women prevalence of smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education Prevalence was substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in rural areas Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 10 Volume 6 Number 10 April 20 1993 men and women below the poverty level this difference was significant only for women p less than 0 05 Table 1 Among men the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those aged 18 44 years but varied considerably by age the prevalence of use of chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group Table 2 Although women rarely used smokeless tobacco the prevalence of snuff use was highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years An estimated 7 9 million 4 4 95 CI 4 1 4 6 adults reported being former smokeless tobacco users Among ever users the proportion who were former smokeless tobacco users was 59 9 95 CI 57 7 62 1 Among persons aged 18 24 years the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users 56 2 95 CI 49 4 63 0 than among chewing tobacco users 70 4 95 CI 64 2 76 6 Among persons aged 45 64 years the proportion of former users was similar for snuff 68 9 95 CI 63 1 74 7 and chewing tobacco 73 5 95 CI 68 9 78 1 Among current users of smokeless tobacco 22 9 95 CI 19 9 26 0 currently smoked 33 3 95 CI 30 0 36 5 formerly smoked and 43 8 95 CI 39 9 47 7 never smoked In comparison among current smokers 2 6 95 CI 2 3 3 0 were current users of smokeless tobacco Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users 67 3 95 CI 63 2 71 4 than among chewing tobacco users 45 1 95 CI 40 6 49 6 Reported by Office on Smoking and Health National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Div of Health Interview Statistics National Center for Health Statistics CDC Editorial Note The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless tobacco was highest among young males Adolescent and young adult males in particular are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility Use of oral snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players encouraging this behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for nicotine addiction oral cancer and other mouth disorders 4 Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among racial ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require further explanation For example targeted marketing practices may play a role in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups and affecting the differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons 5 6 In this report one concern is that nearly one fourth of current smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes In the 1991 NHIS HPDP the prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users In a previous study among college students 18 of current smokeless tobacco users smoked HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 11 Volume 6 Number 10 April 20 1993 occasionally 7 In addition approximately 7 of adults who formerly smoked reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to stop smoking 8 Health care providers should recognize the potential health implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use including males aged 12 24 years to no more than 4 by the year 2000 objective 3 9 and American Indian Alaskan Native youth to no more than 10 by the year 2000 objective 3 9a 9 Strategies to lower the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless tobacco use integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco control efforts enforcing laws that restrict minors access to tobacco making excise taxes commensurate with those on cigarettes encouraging health care providers to routinely provide cessation advice and follow up providing school based prevention and cessation interventions and adopting policies that prohibit tobacco use on school property and at school sponsored events 5 References 1 Office of Evaluations and Inspections Spit tobacco and youth Washington

of my pcs along with windogs and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time It s pretty ugly I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home I paid 369 for it I haven t seen IDE drives cheaper The original CGA cart back in 84 was 300 I think the original EGA card or PGA was 800 SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down in price mainly because we re talking about PC s and not Sun s or Sparc or SGI or name your favorite unix workstation That is after millions of PC buying decisions over the years SCSI has had plenty of time to come down in price No actually we re talking about SCSI being expensive simply because nobody did a common interface for the PC If they had a common read easily implemented method of adding scsi to a PC like as in a Sun or Mac then you d find SCSI the connection medium of choice I won t argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good well implimented data highway but I still want to know why it intrinsically better than IDE on an ISA bus when it comes to multi tasking OS s when managing data from a single SCSI hard drive On a single drive SCSI is more expensive But you bought your PC for expandibility so you d want to add more drives or whatever The following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE A partial list 1 You can add many different types of devices and access them concurrently 2 A SCSI device works on many different machines I have a mac and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice with SCSI hook them up and away they go 3 SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices For instance recently I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor 212 meg IDE The connor MUST be setup as the slave It will work no other way On SCSI you set the address check the termination plug it in and away it goes 4 I have a problem with IDE s mutual exclusion I notice that the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c to drive d is quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c to d on a SCSI system Under a multitasking OS this is very noticable as many things can be going on at once One neat thing that I ve noticed lately a fringe benefit has been the ability to add older almost dead drives as storage on a SCSI system with little problem we ve got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I ve added to my PC I ve now got the interface full but it does allow me to have 4 20 meg drives 1 240 meg drive 1 tape drive and 1 105 meg drive all on the same card Simply put SCSI is handier than IDE No mysterious jumpers to figure out Greg

because all we ve had until a year or two ago was the ISA bus ie no one buys SCSI for ISA because ISA is slow Are you saying that SCSI on an ISA bus is not an automatic winner when compared to IDE You didn t read to carefully VLB IDE uses the same connection mechanism as standard IDE If transfer rate is limited by IDE whether it s interfaced to ISA EISA or VLB matters not I get different transfer rates out of my IDE when I change my ISA bus speed On mine for one thing SCSI blows IDE out of the water hands down If IDE has better throughput why isn t it used on workstations and file servers IDE is just a variant of the old IBM MFM AT controller at least that s how it looks from a software point of view It was never meant to be an all encompassing protocal standard to be implimented across different platforms Is there any argument that IDE can or can t transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the drive is able to provide the data Are SCSI versions of IDE drives able to deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their SCSI interface because of a higher RPM platter different arrangement of heads etc Given the original question SCSI used only as a single hard drive controller is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do at least 5 maybe 10 megs sec for the SCSI choice to make any sence What does a 200 400 meg 5 megs sec SCSI drive cost No that s the nice thing on a multitasking OS SCSI can use both drives at once I ve got unix loaded on one of my pcs along with windogs and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time It s pretty ugly If data is going from one drive to another and if SCSI has the ability to perform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main memory then yes that is the optimal way to do it As far as I know IDE can t do that But when the CPU wants data from both drives data to be stored in main memory are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives at the same time and store transfer that data to main memory also at the same time Working off 1 IRQ and 1 DMA channel on an ISA or whatever bus I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home I paid 369 for it I haven t seen IDE drives cheaper A friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for 320 that s 245 million bytes or 234 mega bytes With the basic 20 interface he gets close to 1 meg sec transfer on his 286 20 Does your figure include a few hundred for SCSI drivers No actually we re talking about SCSI being expensive simply because nobody did a common interface for the PC If they had a common read easily implemented method of adding scsi to a PC like as in a Sun or Mac then you d find SCSI the connection medium of choice So you re saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type considering that the vast majority of PC s don t have cd rom drives or tape backups or etc That most PC s only have or had 1 hard drive and run DOS That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives at the time and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years ago There s a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that prevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice I won t argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good well implimented data highway but I still want to know why it intrinsically better than IDE on an ISA bus when it comes to multi tasking OS s when managing data from a single SCSI hard drive On a single drive SCSI is more expensive But on that point is it faster This is what all this is about Do you get more performance for the money For all the people that will only have a single hard drive in their system regardless of the OS will the SCSI choice really give them more performance than IDE But you bought your PC for expandibility so you d want to add more drives or whatever True but expandibility can also start on the bus which means the option is there for cd rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards 1 You can add many different types of devices and access them concurrently No argument This is always held up to the first time SCSI buyer as the best reason But how many SCSI devices will the first time SCSI buyer eventually acquire Again does it make sense to go SCSI for a single hard drive system 2 A SCSI device works on many different machines I have a mac and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice with SCSI hook them up and away they go With all the postings on the SCSI I or II specs are you really sure that PC and Apple SCSI hard drives are compatible And even if they are is the data accessible from either machine ie are there no formatting partitioning or file table differences Is it really plug n play 3 SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices For instance recently I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor 212 meg IDE The connor MUST be setup as the slave It will work no other way On SCSI you set the address check the termination plug it in and away it goes So the C drive on the connor becomes a logical D drive to DOS Is this really a problem 4 I have a problem with IDE s mutual exclusion I notice that the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c to drive d is quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c to d on a SCSI system Under a multitasking OS this is very noticable as many things can be going on at once After having two IDE drives in my system for temporary file transfers I have never seen any differences when switching between drives nor have I ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or to from the same drive One neat thing that I ve noticed lately a fringe benefit has been the ability to add older almost dead drives as storage on a SCSI system with little problem we ve got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I ve added to my PC I ve now got the interface full but it does allow me to have 4 20 meg drives 1 240 meg drive 1 tape drive and 1 105 meg drive all on the same card That is nice as long as the power supply can keep up I do believe that there is the possibility for up to 4 IDE drives on a PC Simply put SCSI is handier than IDE No mysterious jumpers to figure out But what about mysterious and expensive drivers to figure out At least IDE doesn t require drivers that consume precious conventional DOS memory']"

When you test drive one find a potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable Yes this car s stiff suspension isn t for everyone I personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car I d strongly suggest looking into the MX 6 If you have 3 passengers by all means bring them along too They ll find that they have no room in the back and you ll find that the car rides differently if that s better is up to you The problem with the back seat is that there s no leg room Plenty of head room though Shorter people fit back there without any complaints so long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to give them a place to put their feet Also there s a lot of glass around you which I wasn t expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer My back seat passengers now very few complain about the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combined with the heat The power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car I really enjoy the moonroof by the way but then I ve always been a sucker for open air driving No leakage problems or anything like that yet I ve heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine I haven t heard about this one I know that some of the very early Probes 89 and maybe 90 had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which Ford will replace at no charge but I haven t heard about anything like this concerning the 93 Probes I haven t had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot that was leaking but the dealer took care of that promptly and even gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my car I was quite happy with the way they handled especially considering that I was expecting the worst from them From what I ve heard it sounds like Ford Mazda had some QC problems with the Probe and probably MX 6 when they first went into production but I think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point That s almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this though Hope this helps chuck Chuck Kesler Internet Unix Systems Programmer US Mail Box 7901

youngest of the bunch thus my interest in opinions But every magazine and ratings book places it as an excellent value BTW the 240SX is rear wheel drive and is due for a re design for 1994 Thanks in

now at 9500 miles after debating over the Sentra SE R NX2000 MX6 MR 2 Stealth Prelude and Celica Check this month s Consumer Reports for previous Probe records My criteria a fun car with ABS airbag over 130hp and less than 25K I thought about a turbo but checking with insurance people ruled that out The Tri Star cars Eclipse Talon etc were out since they don t have an air bag Ditto for the Mustang also no ABS The SE R NX2000 M20 fell into the pocket rocket category A good used car buy The MX 6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked I didn t like the Prelude dash instrumentation at all Too weird for me The MR2 has a much smaller non passenger space than I needed so out that went The Celica was ok but underpowered when loaded with options and somewhat overpriced too in non turbo form I never considered the 240SX since it didn t have an airbag I did look at it for its RWD virtues but that s it The Corolla never entered my mind I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4 Dodge Stealth more Since my list was exhausted I bought the Probe The car design is different than earlier years so it s too early to see its reliability so far For what it s worth my comments My

about most Chrysler products Shadow for one always were they moaning about the reguritated K car and engine Whereas Motor Trend always thought they were great cars No car magazine is really objective And although there are alot of people who don t like Consumers Reports I will use them to reinforce my argument I already know about the big stink with the Saturn crash tests time will tell how good a

and the LH s You can find bad stuff about the Shadow Try as I might when I researched the Saturn I could not find anything bad about it There is a great deal of information about this company just because it is a new american company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community for good reason Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of any established company I read an article which had a sub column an I think this imprinted on me more than anything else Some big wig in Toyota said and I quote We are watching them very closely Come on everybody grow up the foreign cars especially the japanese have been kicking our butts for good reason the american car companies could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these days to set in

hundred some odd posts to go but I would think that the real reason to have a moon base is economic Since someone with space industry will presumeably have a much larger GNP than they would _without_ space industry eventually they will simply be able to afford more stuff If I read you right you re saying in essence that with a larger economy nations will have more discretionary funds to waste on a lunar facility That was certainly partially the case with Apollo but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military scientific or commercial reason for being rather than just a we have the money why not approach I was assuming that there won t be a moon base unless it makes a profit actually If it does well that gives a larger GNP which leads to being able to spend more money on your military including gosh wow space stuff assuming it s profitable rather than paying for itself It s conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose it s possible that Luna will have a commercial purpose but it s most likely that Luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred years at least Therefore Lunar bases should be predicated on funding levels little different from those found for Antarctic bases Can you put a 200 person base on the Moon for 30 million a year Even if you use grad students You might be able to _run_ one for that put it there hardly

great respect for the people you speak of I think their cost estimates are a bit over optimistic If nothing else a working SSTO is at least as complex as a large airliner and has a smaller experience base It therefore seems that SSTO development should cost at least as much as a typical airliner development That puts it in the 3G to 5G range For the purpose of a contest I d bet some things could be cut Like fuel for re entry any kind of heat shielding etc etc Even still if the contest participants had to fund DC 1 development it probably wouldn t be worth it to develop DC 1 just for the contest Just give me the cheapest heaviest lift man rated or at least under 6 or so Gs booster If I don t have to pay for DC 1 development great I ll use it But back to the contest goals there was a recent article in AW ST about a low cost it s all relative manned return to the moon A General Dynamics scheme involving a Titan IV Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper stage LEV and crew capsule The mission consists of delivering two unmanned payloads to the lunar surface followed by a manned mission Total cost US was 10 13 billion Joint ESA NASA project was 6 9 billion for the US share I didn t find a mention of how long the crew could stay but I d bet that its around 30 days And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric tonnes So if you ignore the scientific payload hitch a ride in the crew habitation module no return trip and toss in a few more tonnes for the additional consumables to last another 11 months then you might be able to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes and in case its not obvious that s a wild ass guess A pretty boring visit since every trip outdoors eats up a bit of LOX And I m not certain if a home brewed or college brewed life support system could last a year But let s round this up to 19 4 tonnes convient since the GD plan talks about 9 7 ton payloads delivered to the lunar surface This adds up to two Centaurs two LEVs two Shuttle flights All to put a single man on the moon for a year Hmmm Not really practical Anyone got a cheaper better way of delivering 15 20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade Anyone have a more precise guess about how much a year s supply of consumables and equipment would weigh And I was wondering about the GD LEV Is it reusable Or is it discarded to burn up on return to LEO If its not discarded could it be refueled Henry Do you know anything about the GD LEV I noted that it uses RL 10 engines Aren t they reusable restartable Would a LEV fit in a DC 1 I ve forgotten if I ever knew what the cargo bay dimensions are for the DC 1 All in all I m not certain that the single goal prize of staying on the moon for a year is wise and or useful How about A prize for the first non government sponsered unmanned moon landing then another for a manned moon landing then yet another for a system to extract consumables from lunar soil another for a reusable earth moon shuttle and so forth Find some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure Having a single goal might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared to win And for those that didn t give up I find something a little scary about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters I d like to see as much a reward for co operation as for competition Lastly about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an English space magazine that had an on going discussion about moonbases on the cheap I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human body produced how much lunar

sports talk shows almost everywhere that I ve sampled in fact the playoffs almost don t exist now Ranger fans calling in to WFAN or to New York One s midnight sports talk were in a mix of fury over this season and near orgasm over Keenan s hiring Summarizing Keenan is a winner and will give the Broadway Bums da business in pursuing the next Cup chase The Chicago Blackhawks cut their last tie with Keenan when he was forced out as general manager in November He had given up Chicago s coaching duties a year ago and his thirst for the power of a GM now increases the pressure on beleaguered Rangers GM Neil Smith This will be an interesting combination to watch Keenan has been paid enough money to put up and shut up and just be a coach but his advice on any player moves will be listened to closely A lot of big player moves will happen remember that Keenan got rid of Denis Savard The country club days are over When Keenan left Chicago I couldn t help but think about him as our coach Smith said There was an indication he would be taken off the market I feared that and couldn t let that happen If Paramount had given Smith an earlier sign of support and offered Keenan the big money to put up and shut up back in January the Rangers might not be heading for golf now Keenan 43 takes on a demoralized team that offers him a chance to fashion yet another of his reclamation projects at the highest salary ever commanded by an NHL coach The Rangers owned by Gulf Western have bestowed upon Keenan an unprecedented 3 million four year deal I ve known Mike a long time Messier said We ve won two Canada Cups together He s been to the finals three times Maybe we miss just one more element to win the Stanley Cup I don t think he s the same person he was 10 years ago or even five years ago I think he has changed and bettered himself with experience One of Keenan s first statements was a reaffirmation that Mark Messier will be the team s captain The timing of the move gives the

about extremely deeply rooted rivalry Deeply rooted rivalry Ahem Jokerit have been around since 1967 and joined the top flight only in the early 70s Helsingfors IFK have been around since 1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think you re exagerating here However it s been proved that both fan groups can cheer the same team that s the Finnish national team Maybe that s how you could set up a huge franchise in Finland No one has ever said that the team must be called after one city or play all its games on one arena Just one Team Finland and Team Sweden in the NHL just wouldn t make any sense we have way more talent than 1 24th of the total of North American talent After a couple of seasons you would never see the cup going anywhere outside the Nordic presuming that our teams would have the advantage in drafting local talent as prooposed That s a rather bold claim in the light of how successful the Canadian American Olympic teams have been and they ve had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice The 1992 Olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team Canada had Eric Lindros Sean Burke Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos Another four or five have been deep subs in the NHL As for the Yanks Keith Tkachuk Scott Lachance Bret Hedican Shawn McEachern Steve Heintze Ted Donato Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been 3rd 4th line players in the NHL while Robb Stauber has done well for the Kings in goal Nothing more In fact I m sure that an All Star team assembled from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford or Tampa Bay currently are doing But what happens if _all_ top class Finnish Swedish players gradually end up with Helsinki Stockholm as the North American based ones

players combined If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in Sweden an all Swedish team would assemble about 350 360 skill points Deducting some points from Pittsburgh NY Rangers and other teams that rely on Swedish players the Swedish team would finish in sixth place about as high as Boston Vancouver Calgary and Montreal on paper So the dynasty talk isn t completely unfounded here An all Finnish all Swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time won t have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language and presumably play the wide open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the North American checking game However if free agency becomes a factor the top Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large market teams after a couple of years the same way Edmonton s dynasty crumbled in the late 80s Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all I d settle for a compromise prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players After this the amateur draft should be open to anyone J O O J O O J O K E R I T Finland over Czech in the Final B R U I N P O W E R Bruins over Blackhawks in 6 MARCU']"

the guy responsible for much of the uniforms and props used by the early Nazis in their rallies and such The name is Roehm not Rhoemer And Hitler does claim that he came up with the Swastika business But didn t he credit the actual flag design to a party member some dentist or other I believe he gives such credit in Mein Kampf He was killed in an early Nazi purge He and many of his associates were flaming homosexuals well know also for their flamboyant orgies I have been trying to find if there is any actual evidence for this common assertion recently Postings to such groups as soc history and soc culture german has not uncovered any net experts who could provide any Well I m no expert but all of the histories of Nazi Germany assert this They make reference to several scandals that occurred long before the night of the long knives The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of the SA was common knowledge Also a book by a homosexual author whose name escapes me at the moment called Homosexuals in History asserts that Roehm and Heines were homosexuals as well as others in Roehm s SA circle All the books say that Roehm and his associate Edmund Heines were homosexual I have been able to find nothing beyond that and suspect this to be a sort of historical urban legend Well you re the one who is in Germany If you don t believe the history books look up the primary sources yourself Those of us outside of Germany do not have access to these You do It seems to me that there were plenty of documented instances several scandals the fact that on the knight of the long knives several SA members including Heines were found sleeping together etc Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA s homosexual activities seducing young boys etc The histories that I ve read make a very convincing case None of this sounds like urban legend to me Irving a notoriously unreliable historian says that Funk the Nazi finance minister was homosexual He gives no sources I know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk What precisely do you know that would contradict all of the other history books that I have read concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis Are you trying to say that all historians are taking part in an anti homosexual smear What about homosexual writers who agree with the official history Don t you think they would have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals I would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism No one should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case I challenge anyone to document this claim If you are going to challenge all historians on this point not just Irving then the burden of proof is on you Track down the references Find out where the stories originate from Again you are the one in Germany close to archival material most people on the net are not I have found a great deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the Nazis This seems to include all of the worst ones Hitler Himmler Goebbels Goering Heydrich Eichmann and many more Eh What is your agenda here To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals so that you can bash heterosexuals Does it bother you that some of the Nazis might have been homosexuals Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is true Of course not And what about bisexuals Are they half Nazis I don t know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were homosexuals The German officer corps before WW1 for instance was notorious for its homosexuality There were numerous scandals which rocked the German govt during the late 19th and early 20th century Many of the Kaiser s friends were prosecuted the Kaiser was no homosexual but the Germany army had a long tradition of tolerating homosexuality going far back into Prussian history back to Frederick the Great at least who was himself a homosexual Roehm was a product of this Prussian officer tradition and the old German army like the English public school system being a well known center of homosexuality would have been quite willing to overlook Roehm s homosexuality In addition some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth The Hitler Youth swallowed up all pre Nazi youth groups and some of the various pre war Vandervogel Bund and Volkish youth groups were known to promote homoerotic ideals and friendship and in many cases homosexuality itself So it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis regardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the evils of homosexuality Why should this suprise anyone Homosexuality has always existed in all societies it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception No I don t have any sources for you as I think the only kind of proof you will accept would be citations from archival material and I do not have access to these Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and

23 15 14 00 1993 Lines 197 From Center for Policy Research cpr Subject Symbiotics Zionism Antisemitism Zionism and the Holocaust by Haim Bresheeth The first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history of the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without anti semitism is impossible Zionism agrees with the basic tenet of anti Semitism namely that Jews cannot live with non Jews The history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way While the industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942 its roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century Jewish aspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles in Europe When the hopes for liberation through bourgeois democratic change were dashed other alternatives for improving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence The socialist Bund a mass movement with enormous following had to contend with opposition from a new and small almost insignificant opponent the political Zionists In outline these two offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe While the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of Europe s workers the Zionists were proposing a new programme aimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a Jewish state Historically nothing is inevitable all depends on the balance of forces involved in the struggle History can be seen as an option tree every time a certain option is chosen other routes become barred Because of that choice movement backwards to the point before that choice was made is impossible While Zionism as an option was taken by many young Jews it remained a minority position until the first days of the 3rd Reich The Zionist Federation of Germany ZVfD an organisation representing a tiny minority of German Jews was selected by the Nazis as the body to represent the Jews of the Reich Its was the only flag of an interantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin and this was the only international organisation allowed to operate during this period From a marginal position the leaders of the Zionist Federation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that surprised even them All of a sudden they attained political power power based not on representation but from being selected as the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the Jewish problem Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements that affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in Germany transformed them from a utopian marginal organisation in Germany and some other countries in Europe into a real option to be considered by German Jews The best example of this was the Transfer Agreement of 1934 Immediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933 Jews all over the world supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German goods This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German authorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott It was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull out the campaign would collapse This problem was solved by the ZVfD A letter sent to the Nazi party as early as 21 June 1933 outlined the degree of agreement that existed between the two organisations on the question of race nation and the nature of the Jewish problem and it offered to collaborate with the new regime The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of Jews abroad against the German development Boycott propaganda such as is currently being carried out against Germany in many ways is in essence unZionist because Zionism wants not to do battle but to convince and build In their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new regime the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott The main public act was the signature of the Transfer Agreement with the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934 In essence the agreement was designed to get Germany s Jews out of the country and into Mandate Palestine It provided a possibility for Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the country through a transfer of German goods to Palestine This right was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination The Zionist organisation was the acting agent through its financial organisations This agreement operated on a number of fronts helping Jews to leave the country breaking the ring of the boycott exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine and last but not least enabling the regime to be seen as humane and reasonable even towards its avowed enemies the Jews After all they argued the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the Jews come and agree with them After news of the agreement broke the boycott was doomed If the Zionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with the Nazis and import their goods who could argue for a boycott This was not the first time that the interests of both movements were presented to the German public as complementary Baron Von Mildenstein the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS later followed by Eichmann was invited to travel to Palestine This he did in early 1933 in the company of a Zionist leader Kurt Tuchler Having spent six months in Palestine he wrote a series of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the new Jew of Zionism a Jew Nazis could accept and understand This little known episode established quite clearly the relationship during the early days of Nazism between the new regime and the ZVfD a relationship that was echoed later in a number of key instances even after the nature of the Final Solution became clear In many cases this meant a silencing of reports about the horrors of the exterminations A book concentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the Holocaust is Post Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the Holocaust by S B Beth Zvi In the case of the Kastner episode around which Jim Allen s play PERDITION is based even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of the real nature of events does not exist It occured near the end of the war The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany Italy and the African bases had been lost The Nazis were on the run with a number of key countries such as Rumania leaving the Axis A second front was a matter of months away as the western Allies prepared their forces In the midst of all this we find Eichmann the master bureaucrat of industrial murder setting up his HZ in occupied Budapest after the German takeover of the country in April 1944 His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish leadership and to appoint Zionist Federation members headed by Kastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their relationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities Why they did this is not difficult to see As opposed to Poland where its three and a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly different from the rest of the Polish population the Hungarian Jews were an integrated part of the community The middle class was mainly Jewish the Jews were mainly middle class They enjoyed freedom of travel served in the Hungarian fascist army in fronline units as officers and soldiers their names were Hungarian how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be exterminated The task was not easy there were a million Jews in Hungary most of them resident the rest being refugees from other countries Many had heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere and were unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials Like elsewhere the only people who had the information and the ear of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat In this case the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members Without their help the SS with 19 officers and less than 90 men plus a few hundred Hungarian police could not have collected and controlled a million Jews when they did not even know their whereabouts Kastner and the others were left under no illusions Eichmann told Joel Brand one of the members of Kastner s committee that he intended to send all Hungary s Jews to Auschwitz before he even started the expulsions He told them clearly that all these Jews will die 12 000 a day unless certain conditions were met The Committee faced a simple choice to tell the Jews of Hungary about their fate with neutral Rumania where many could escape being in most cases a few hours away or to collaborate with the Nazis by assisting in the concentration process What would not have been believed when coming from the SS sounded quite plausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership Thus it is that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their death assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to work camps To be sure there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of destruction the trains of prominents which Eichmann promised to Kastner a promise he kept to the last detail For Eichmann it was a bargain allowing 1 680 Jews to survive as the price paid for the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million Jews There was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be located not to say murdered without the full collaboration of Kastner and his few friends No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews here and there but the scale of the operation would have been miniscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz It is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration like say Rumkovsky in Lodz Kastner acted as a result of his strongly held Zionist convictions His actions were a logical outcome of earlier positions This is instanced when he exposed to the Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs Palgi and Senesh and persuaded them to give themselves up so as not to disrupt his operations At no point during his trial or elsewhere did Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those Jews To conclude the role played by Zionists in this period was connected to another role they could and should have played that of alarming the whole world to what was happening in Europe They had the information but politically it was contrary to their priorities The priorities were and still are quite simple All that furthers the Zionist enterprise in Palestine is followed whatever the price The lives of individuals Jews and non Jews are secondary If this process requires dealing with fascists Nazis and other assorted dictatorial regimes across the world so be it']"

on my body and tore my clothes all at the same time I don t even know what I said The atrocities started I was savagely raped in that room They argued among themselves who would go first DEPOSITION OF KARINE KARINA GRIGOREVNA M 1 Born 1964 Secretary Typist Azsantekmontazh Trust Sumgait Construction and Installation Administration Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization Resident at Building 17 33B Apartment 15 Microdistrict No 3 Sumgait Azerbaijan On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o clock show at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee about 50 yards away The SK theater They were showing an Argentinian film The Abyss Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at the City Party Committee but they were silent there s no conversation whatsoever and we couldn t figure out what was going on That is we knew it was about Karabagh but what it was exactly what they were talking about if someone gave a speech or not we didn t know We bought our tickets There were 30 or 40 people in the theater This was a very small number for that large movie theater The film started About 30 minutes later they stopped the film A crowd burst in About 60 people They came up onto the stage Well mostly they were young people from 16 to 23 years old They demanded that an Armenian woman come up onto the stage They used foul language and said that they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of what they could do to Armenian girls I thought that s what they meant because they had demanded a girl specifically Marina and I were sitting together I told her to move over there were some Russian girls sitting nearby So that if someone recognized me or if something happened they would take me and not Marina It got quiet 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out but the door was closed it s only opened at the end of the show and they returned to their seats Everyone in the theater was looking at one another Russians Azerbaijanis people of various nationalities But no one reacted at all no one in the auditorium made a sound They were silent looking at one another and gradually started to leave Some guy a really fat one says OK we ve scared them enough let s leave They leave slowly pompously It seemed to me that those people were not themselves Either they had smoked a bunch of anasha or had taken something else because they all looked beastly like they were ready to tear anyone apart Then it was all over as though nothing had happened at all The film started up again it was one of those cheerful films which should have only brought pleasure made you happy to be alive We could barely sit to the end So it had started at seven it was over by nine and it was dark Marina and I were walking home Lenin Street that s the center of town Lenin Street was packed just packed with young people They were shouting something about Karabagh and something about Armenians We weren t especially listening because the way we were feeling we didn t know if we were going to make it home or not and just what had happened anyway Public transportation wasn t running Incidentally when we came out of the theater we saw police policemen standing there The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors because when they were leaving they had broken the glass the doors there are basically all glass Everything was broken He stood there grief stricken but looking as though nothing really big had happened like some naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident with a slingshot Well since he looked more or less calm I decided that nothing all that super serious had happened We went out very slowly we wanted to catch a bus we live literally one stop away We didn t want to go on foot not because it was dark but because something might happen We flagged down a cab but the driver didn t want to take us We told him we live near the bus station and he said he d take us to the bus station and not a yard farther I said well OK So we got into the cab and managed to get there Something incredible was happening at the bus station There was a traffic jam Public transportation was at a standstill and everyone was shouting Ka ra bagh they re not going to give up Karabagh I go home and tell my family what s going on and there s immediate panic in the house Mamma says what should we do Like the end had come they were going to come kill us that s it Somehow we managed to cheer ourselves up Nothing that bad could happen Where are we living anyway just what kind of social order do we have Somehow we manage to calm Mamma down And we went to bed But no one could sleep Everyone made as though nothing had happened That was on Saturday In short the day went by We didn t go anywhere and didn t call our relatives No one did anything Because life goes on That day I realized something was approaching but what exactly I couldn t guess On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be we lived like we always had There were five of us at home Mamma Papa and us three sisters Lyuda Marina and I My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time We sat at home and no one went out Later we learned that a demonstration had started that morning It all started They were smashing up stores We were sitting at home and didn t know anything about it Then a girlfriend of mine Lyuda Zimogliad came by at around three o clock I think We worked together we did our apprenticeships together she s a Russian girl She said that something awful was happening in town I asked Don t they want Armenians Well what are they after if they re already in that state She says no nothing like that it s just a demonstration but it s awful to watch it Somehow it feels like a war has broken out Public transportation has been stopped The cabs the buses well it s just a nightmare Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore my mother was having allergy problems at the time He left the house and our neighbor Aunt Vera asked him Where are you going Stop There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard aren t you afraid to go out Papa didn t know what she was talking about She simply pushed him back into the entryway He came home and told Mamma Mamma said Well if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on But we didn t go see her she s a Russian she lives across from us I had to see my friend out Around five o clock I tell Lyuda Ok look it s time for you to go it s late already I ll see you out Mamma says You don t need to go it s too late already you can see what the situation in town is So we decided to stay home Dinner was ready Mamma says Let her eat with us then she can go We sat down at the table But no one was hungry no one was in the mood we just put everything out on the table to calm ourselves down and make it appear that we re eating We turned on the television and the show In Fairy Tale Land was coming on We cleared the table We hear some noise out in the courtyard I go out on the balcony but I can t see what s going on because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station and there is a 9 story building in the way There is mob of people I can t figure out what s happening They re shouting something looking somewhere I can t make out what is going on I go down to a neighbor she s an Azerbaijani we ve been friends of her family for about 25 years I go down to look from their place I see people shouting looking at the 5 and 9 story buildings near the bus station Just then soldiers set upon them about 20 people with clubs The mob runs off in different directions I even see several people from our building They are looking and laughing I decide that means it s not all that bad if they are laughing it means they re not killing anyone But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers One of the soldiers cannot manage to get away they start stomping on him with their feet everyone s kicking him I become ill and go home and explain in general terms that horrible things are going on out there can t speak Well they ve probably killed that soldier the way that crowd is If each of them kicked him just once They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it But it was far away and I couldn t see if he got up and left or not I become terrified and go home and say Lyuda don t go anywhere stay at our place because if you go out they could kill you or Then the crowd runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12 story building and starts shouting something We go out onto the balcony All of our neighbors are also out on theirs too Everyone is standing staring The mob is shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building As it turns out at the 12 story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and kept them from coming in There s only one entryway there they could stop them They all run up to our building Mamma immediately starts closing the windows afraid that they might throw stones They have stones and they break the windows all of them There are very many people We have a large courtyard and it s packed with people They spill up to the first floor so they don t crush each other They crawl up on trees posts and garages It s just a huge cloud of people They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey Sargisian from our building We close the windows and immediately hear tramping in our entryway They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous din and roar It s incomprehensible Mamma told me later that they were shouting Father s name Grisha open the door we ve come to kill you or something like that I don t remember that I was spaced out kind of Mamma says Into the bedroom quickly In the bedroom we have two tall beds part of our dowry Mamma says Hide there they probably won t come in there they ll ask something say something and leave She says We ll tell them that we live alone here I can t imagine that my parents will stand out in the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts I go to them and say that I ll stand together with them I ll talk with them if they come maybe I can find a common language with them all the more so if they know me I speak Azerbaijani more or less and I can find out what they want I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed and my sister Lyuda I can t remember if I told her anything or not Then they open the door it s like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall The crows bursts in and starts to shout Get out of here leave vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia things like that I tell them What has happened speak calmly One of you tell me calmly what has happened In Azerbaijani they say Get out of the apartment leave I say OK Go downstairs We ll gather everything we need and leave the apartment I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them these are animals They must be stopped The ones standing in the doorway the young guys say There are old people and one girl with them Too bad They take two or three steps back It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange Then someone in the courtyard shouts commanding them Don t you understand what you are saying Kill them And that was it That was all it took They grab Papa carry him into one room and Mamma and me into another They put Mamma on the bed and start undressing her beating her legs They start tearing my clothes right there in front of Mamma I don t remember where they went what they did or how much time passed I had the feeling that they beat me on the head on my body and tore my clothes all at the same time I don t even know what I said The atrocities started I was savagely raped in that room They argued among themselves who would go first Later I remember I came to I don t know if I m dead or alive Someone comes in someone tall I think clean shaven in an Eskimo dogskin coat balding He looks around at what s happening At that instant everything stops It seems to me that he is either their commander or that somehow everything depends on him He looks and says Well we re done here They are beating Mamma on the head They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs She loses consciousness and they decide that she s dead Papa was out cold They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony but they can t get the window open Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the windows can t be opened They leave her next to the window She was thinking about being thrown out the window and passed out She s not a real strong person anyway He looks at me and sees that I m saying something that I m still twitching Well I start saying the opposite of what I should be which is humbling myself and pleading I start shouting cursing they don t get any entreaty out of me I already know that I m dead why would I humble myself before anyone And he says that if that s what I think since my tongue is so long maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing In short he commands that I be taken outside I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda I don t know if they are alive or not They take me outside They are dragging me by my arms by my legs They are hitting me against the wall the railings something metal While they are carrying me someone is biting me someone else is pinching me I don t even know I think my God when will death come If only it were sooner Then they carry me out throw me near the entryway and start kicking me I lose consciousness What happened after that how many people there were I don t remember I come to after a while I don t remember how long A neighbor is bringing me clothing I m entirely covered with blood she puts a dress on me I remember that I said the same words over and over again Mamma what happened Mamma what have they done to us where are we whose house are we at I can t make sense out of anything There is a guy standing over me I sort of know him he served in Afghanistan his name is Igor he brought me indoors When they all went to the third entryway and killed a person there Igor gathered his courage took me into his arms and brought me to the neighbors even though he s small minded he put himself at risk Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani he served in Afghanistan There are three brothers The older brother also served there I think now he s stationed here on the border in Armenia Igor brought me to the neighbors and then helped me come to my senses saying Karina I know you calm down I m not one of them How do I know who s who and what s what I come to and they clean me up I was covered in blood Then Papa I saw Papa I saw Mamma And Marina too Igor was there when they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed Marina Lyuda said that she was Russian they said we ll let you go we aren t touching the Russians go And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she s going to tell them she s Azerbaijani Igor immediately grabs Marina s and Lyuda s hands because he knows Marina and knows that she is Armenian and is our sister and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor s and starts pounding on the door so she will open up She opens the door and Igor pushes them in there So they survived My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things While they were going downstairs taking things downstairs then coming back up again Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed there Then when she was herself again she found a torn night shirt and put it on and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor s on the fourth floor the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from the friend of ours and knocked on the door The neighbor opened and said I m not going to let you in the apartment because I m afraid of them But I ll give you some stockings and we ll leave the building Lyuda says I ll stay at your place because of what s going on they keep going up and down the stairs It was just for a moment just a moment in life but the neighbor wouldn t consent Lyuda came back to our place and lay under the bed I came to Mother was there I can t remember my supervisor s telephone number but something had to be done Somehow I remembered and called and he came to get us He didn t have any idea what was going on He thought we were simply afraid he didn t know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death He came and got us and took us to the police precinct There they looked us over I was having trouble walking my lungs hurt badly it was hard to breathe My supervisor s name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov He s the head of our administration They took us there When we were leaving I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town The buses were ordinary passenger buses There were very many soldiers We left around eleven right after eleven If these people could stop what was happening they could save a great many lives Because the crowd was moving on toward the school and what was going on there I think everyone know not only in Sumgait not only in Yerevan Because there they murdered them all one after the next without stopping After us I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No 3 and 10 to 12 of them were from Buildings 4 5 and 6 In our building one person died and one old woman died from Building 16 that s the building in front of ours There young Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn t let it into their building Incidentally when we were at the neighbors Marina called our relatives to warn them so they would all know what was happening I called a aunt in Microdistrict No 5 They have three neighbors who are Armenians I said Run quickly I can t explain what s going on hide do what you can just stay alive Hide at Azerbaijanis ones who won t give you away At that moment three people came in policemen I think they were Azerbaijanis I was in such awful condition my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up there was blood my eye was swollen no one thought I would ever see anything out of that eye again my forehead was badly cut and one half of my face was pushed out forward No one would have thought that I would survive get my normal appearance back and be able to grasp anything at all I started to scream at those people why did you come who sent you here no one wants you here haven t you killed people people yet what are you doing here One of the soldiers said Don t scream at us We re Muslims but we re not from the Sumgait police They called in from Daghestan So at that point the Daghestan police were there When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there there were soldiers police with dogs ambulances firemen I don t know maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously injured to treat them there in the police precinct I don t know what they were there for There were also doctors from Baku there They examined Lyuda and me and said These women need to go to the Maternity Home but we don t know what to do with the rest So they took us and I lost contact with my parents my boss everyone My boss said Don t worry I ll find you no matter where you are no matter what happens We went to the hospital There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home Pashayeva I think her name was She examined us The ambulance was from Baku I figured out that the Sumgait ambulances hadn t done anything they didn t respond to any calls People called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened for she became quite glad I even thought to myself God can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong She looks me over and says Now why are you suffering so You don t know what your people have been doing your people did even worse things And I think great I have to deal with her And I felt so bad I thought why don t I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her Here I am in this condition and being told about something that our people did I just didn t have the energy to say How could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours haven t already done I stayed there Then they brought in another woman Ira B she was married and she was raped in her own apartment too There were three of us Ira Lyuda and 1 The next morning they took Lyuda and Ira away They didn t do anything to help us This was in the old Maternity Home in the combined block They didn t do anything more than examine me that was it I didn t want any shots or tranquilizer nothing What shots could have calmed me down I didn t even want to look at them I lay in the ward Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur pose but I was alone I was alone even though the wards were packed That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me that my face was disfigured She asked what had happened to me and I said Better to ask your brother what happened there s no point in asking me your brother can better explain what happened She fell into a faint All the doctors threw themselves at her and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward Then people from work came to see me my boss his daughter they brought me clothing because I was literally naked The only thing I had on was a dress but the woman who gave it to me was very short and the dress was way up above my knees and the woman orderly said I can t believe you put on such a short dress who are you showing off your legs to here I went back to my ward thinking just one more thing from something People from work came and brought me something in a sack apples I think three or four pounds but I couldn t take them I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing I said that I couldn t take the apples and really didn t have any appetite No one had to bring me anything Some woman took the sack And oh yes Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an Armenian maybe they wouldn t figure it out from looking at me So they must have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack that something else would happen That it would be worse Or perhaps someone was outside on the street I don t know In any case I didn t sleep a wink that night The next morning they picked me up a whole police detail put me in a bus and off we went I didn t even know where they were taking me They took me to the club where the troops were the very one I was in that ill fated evening I got off the bus Near the City Party Committee there were a great many troops tanks armored personnel carriers the whole scene was terrible I saw a few people I knew there and that calmed me a little I had already thought that I was the only one left So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait after that night I still didn t know what happened to my parents they didn t come to see me in the hospital and my boss told me that everything was fine I didn t know whether to believe him or not Maybe he was just trying to calm me down maybe something happened on the way Then I went to the club and saw a lot of people I knew They all knew one another they were all kissing each other and asking What happened what went on Two days later they came to see me from work They were there all the time Each day they came showed interest and were constantly bringing me money They did everything they could Of course I m most thankful to my boss the only one of my colleagues who didn t lose his presence of mind and who didn t change his opinions neither before nor after nor in the heat of the moment no matter what happened He constantly took an interest A sincere interest from the heart Then about two days later the secretary of the Party Committee came not from our Party organization but from the First Trust which ours is part of Comrade Kerimov a very important figure in our town He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away because if I sat down by myself I couldn t get up or lie down again There was something wrong with my lungs it was hard to breathe They examined me there several times there I lay were several doctors they all thought that that it must just be from all the blows I don t know They didn t diagnose anything in particular When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked I made it a point of insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful There was no way something inside wasn t broken my ribs Well they took me there and took x rays and said that everything was fine There were emergency medical workers on duty in the club The mother of one of Marina s friends was there She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children s Clinic They had every kind of antifever agent in the world which was exactly what I needed at that moment I thought I said that I was having great difficulty breathing I couldn t seem to get enough air something was wrong with me They put tight bandages around my chest and waist Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all over I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut But I wasn t cut They took us to the Khimik boarding house We lived there a long time Soon appeared representatives They were agitating At first people would not talk to them and drove them off One of the Armenian women shouted We demand that Seidov come The response was It s Seidov who sent us Seidov is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers The woman said We ll only see Seidov s daughter have her come here we ll do the same things to her that they did to our daughters and then we ll deal with you agitators And so on More of them said Have Seidov himself come This went on day in day out The agitators kept coming and coming this drove us out of our wits Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because they realized it was senseless to stay Everything got on our nerves The smell the small children There were children at the SK club children who had literally just come out of the Maternity Home What were they doing in a club that didn t even have running water all the time At first we had to pay to eat there They even overcharged us as it turned out On the second day someone told us that they would bring us food for free The children were ill Everything stank there Well imagine about 3 000 people in a small movie theater with seating for no more than 500 You couldn t sit or lie down it was impossible to even move The stench was awful Even the smallest infants took ill overnight there I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in Yerevan the infants They have to be washed they have to be bathed not to mention that we the adults were ill and needed care People were fainting right and left I just don t know everyone was crying everyone Only the young people the men somehow managed to keep it together But the women were in a constant state of panic It seemed to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab It seemed clear that we had been gathered together purposely like during the war so that they could burn the movie theater and there wouldn t be a single Armenian left Then people went up to the attic I didn t see them I only heard them because I was lying down and couldn t get up I lay right on the stage we had some room there Apparently they caught two people with either oil or gas I think they wanted to burn the theater Maybe someone saw them I didn t I was in no condition to open my eyes Everyone was suspicious of everyone else They would ask Aren t you an Azerbaijani I think I saw you somewhere I think you re an Azerbaijani They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports relatives might be covering for each other Half of the people did not have any documents There were people who had run out of their homes in nothing but a pair of pants and slippers or wearing just a shirt not like they should have with their IDs So on the 28th on Sunday I think the police did nothing to help us On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A They didn t spare a soul there not children not pregnant women nobody They killed they burned they hacked with axes just everything possible They murdered the Melkumian family whom I knew my mother worked with them Their daughter in law went to school with my older sister They were brutally murdered Only the two daughters in law survived By a miracle one was able to save herself she ran away the neighbors wouldn t take her in so she ran about the building until she found refuge She was pregnant and had two small children This all continued on Monday in Block 41A on the 29th when the troops were already in the city They murdered people they overturned automobiles and they burned entire families They say they didn t even know for sure if the people were Armenians or not I heard that the Lezgins suffered too I m not sure myself I didn t see any Lezgins who had been injured They burned cars so it s very difficult now to say exactly who died and who didn t It was very difficult to identify the corpses or rather what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned it s all very hard to imagine of course I heard that many people disappeared without a trace from the BTZ plant two people including a woman who worked the night shift Aunt Razmella who also lived in Microdistrict 3 They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait In the evening people who had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait and people from Baku were going home from Sumgait and there were students too They were simply savagely murdered They were stopping the buses the drivers immediately did what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally minded people They stopped the buses dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the spot I didn t see it myself but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them Later it was hard to discern from the corpses well you can t call them corpses you had to figure out from the ashes who it was l heard that two fellows saved two women one a student Ira G if I m not mistaken She was in the hospital a long time after that and she still can t figure out who saved her She was also brutally raped and beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses The fellow pulled her out of that whole pile of corpses put his coat on her took her into his arms and carried her to the city I still can t imagine how he managed to do that I heard that from Engels Grigorian He knows her apparently Well a lot of people went to that hospital anyway She was in the hospital and singing a song in Armenian and they wrote the words down and I think he still has that piece of paper because he says that a lot of people now have that song the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape They couldn t find the guy who saved her He left her in someone s apartment and called the ambulance she was in such awful shape that probably like me she couldn t remember anyone s face I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house maybe I had talked with him once But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head I can t remember to this day who he was Then it seems I saw the Secretary of the Directorate s Party organization where Marina works She goes to school and works she goes to night school at AZI and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration I m the Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations We had joint meetings I know them all I ve even talked with them and he I know is from Armenia An Azerbaijani but from Armenia It became obvious that many of those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia They took me to various police stations to the police precinct and to the Procuracy because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case and I iden tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize They showed me the people who were in our apartment they re working on our case but I can t even recognize them although it was proved that they were the ones they re processing it somehow They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were dragging me There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch me he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that All these people all of them as much as I ve heard about them and seen them they were all from Kafan The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf Najaf Rzayev He was there when everything started It must have been him because I didn t recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him All the more since I told him Listen you do something because you know me He turned away and went toward the bedroom where Marina was Well you couldn t see Marina anyway There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn t make out anyone All of it flew right out of my head and then gradually I became myself again at the City Party Committee There were military people there I told them what went on and they wrote it all down I told them his name On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization the one we re part of came to see us his name is Najaf Rzayev I tell Mamma If he s here despite the fact that I gave his name it means that either his alibi has been confirmed or probably that they think I m crazy not responsible for my words He said What did they do to you how awful myself I hid an Armenian family Then after some time goes by he comes back again and says something entirely different I wasn t at home my family and I went to Baku I said Marina what is he saying He said something totally different before After that I didn t go to see our Procurator our case is being handled by a procurator from Voronezh Fedorov by name Fedorov told me that Rzayev s case had just gotten to him and there were so names involved What are they doing with Rzayev Did he prove his alibi or not They just think that since I was hit in the head I can t say anything for sure whether it was him or not It will be an insult if he was in our apartment and doesn t have to pay for it but at the same time I m afraid to say I m a hundred percent sure that it was he Because no mat ter who I name they tell me no you re wrong he didn t do that that one wasn t there All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind Who did what exactly I can t say When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there but I didn t see it because I had my eyes closed all the time It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes people were always hassling me for some reason it always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible When they were beating my face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out So I had my eyes closed they took me outside and started to beat me A young guy 22 held my arms he works at the BTZ plant And right nearby across the road from us Block 41 is where all this was going on Right across the road from us The BTZ dormitory is over there that s where he lives Now he s in custody they even have proved as far as I know that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building One person in our building was killed it was that man A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me but he didn t come over he just looked and then went into the dormitory A while after it was all over people started making announcements in town saying that investigators had been summoned That guy went and told them everything Now they ve caught him everything s been proved Now evidently they ve been beating him I don t know what they re doing with them over there but he himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant Some young guy came to the plant and said Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the bus station on Saturday at ten That was it He said the ones who wanted to went This was at the BTZ plant during the night shift probably late Friday night It was at night they were at the sauna together And he said what do you mean do you understand what you are saying The others were silent probably in their hearts they were thinking I m going to go But they didn t say anything to one another He said that he thought it important to to go because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan that they had killed their Azerbaijani sisters their mothers burned villages and all of that That guy was also born in Kafan That is certain And Marina says that the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia too from I ve participated in the investigation a couple of times I m satisfied with them thus far They summoned us and asked about what happened and every word I said was recorded I met some guy there By the way he was an Armenian I said that he was in our apartment but what he did I don t know His last name was Grigorian Eduard Grigorian He s from Sumgait from Microdistrict 1 He was sentenced I think to five years not his first time His mother is Russian I met with him at the KGB in Baku at the Azerbaijani KGB They took us there and showed me photographs There were so many photographs I think they even photographed those people who were caught at curfew and I ve got them all confused I say the face was about like this the guy in the white coat with the red clasps But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere and it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack Well This guy Grigorian I said he was in our apartment but he is so light complected that he looks like a Lezgin I don t know what he did I can t remember Maybe he beat me or raped me But he was in our apartment At the KGB he started asking me pleading with me there s no need for this all this stuff look me in the eyes you re like a sister to me I took a look at him and thought My God Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like you But they were satisfied with my responses because I said everything without great certainty I was there with Mamma Then Lyuda came in but when she came in she got sick immediately She wanted to kill him she crawled over the table at him She recognized him When she came to Lyuda was lying on the balcony the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom We had all kinds of boxes with dishes in them the dowries for all three sisters They stole everything in the apartment leaving only small things At that moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything Well seeing the faces hearing the voices Two people were saying they could burn the apartment Another says why burn the apartment when I ve got three kids and no place to live So this guy was in temporary housing he didn t have anywhere to live he was from Sumgait They were sure that they would get the apartment Besides the neighbors were Azerbaijani Why should they burn the apartment they might burn Azerbaijanis That s what they said How did they know there were Azerbaijanis there if they just picked a place thinking that Armenians lived there We have a list of the residents for our part of the building our name is in there but how could they know that Azerbaijanis lived on the other side of the wall from us So they didn t set fire to our apartment I don t know I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt when I was outside if someone had asked me what was happening I would have said that a civil war was going on Well maybe not civil but probably civil because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching like at a free horror film So a civil war was going on and only the Armenians were being fought If it were a world war or something like that they would have been fighting everyone But they only fought us Then I met some women from our building some Azerbaijanis They are crying they tell me Karina we saw all of it how could it happen They re asking me Well I just don t know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to me I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn t have been able to take it or I would have tried to avert it like that one Azerbaijani woman did in front of our building A woman lives there an awful dissipated woman if you can call her a woman the dissipated life she leads Two Armenian families live there in her part of the building She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse She came down to the entryway and said You ll come in this entryway over my dead body So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway Some folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn t even know what they were doing I don t think that s true They knew very well what they were doing if they didn t even lift a hand against that woman They couldn t have cared less about her but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani stopped them They were just beasts they had smoked so much When they came to our place they were all chewing something I noticed Everyone who came into the apartment was chewing something I think my God maybe I just think that Maybe I m losing my mind But no they re all chewing something Maybe it is some kind of drug it must be because At first glance they all seemed to be such normal people young clean shaven looking exactly as if they had come to some sort of celebration But they were shouting something They didn t talk they shouted as though there were deaf people there They screamed and screamed Yeah killing killing we re killing the Armenians Only they didn t shout kill they shouted gurun ermianlary Gurun literally means kill or destroy That s how it was I ll continue We hid in a captain s apartment he s an Azerbaijani his wife is a Tatar We were sitting in their apartment their kids were out in the yard Their kids knew a whole lot This was in our part of the building on the third floor When Mamma came to and couldn t find Lyuda she took Papa s hand this was while the looters were stealing things but they didn t pay attention because they were stealing things Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing Mamma found the courage to A boy said to my mother Where s the gold Mamma said he must have been 12 to 14 years old He even looked Russian he was so fair skinned But the Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair skinned I noticed they were all on the fair side He shouted they were all smashing things and he asks Mamma where the gold is We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers In a little black bag we kept everything in there Mamma doesn t really like to wear gold She probably never even wore those things from the time they were bought for her They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass Mamma thinks that the gold saved us Because they threw themselves at the gold and Mamma grabbed Papa who was trying to breathe They had closed his mouth bound his hands and put a pillow and a chair on his face They had shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate Mamma grabbed him and tore all that stuff off He had something in his mouth he was having trouble breathing his nose was filled with blood Mamma grabbed him and started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted to open their doors to them Mamma said that by accident completely by accident that person opened his door he was sleeping and said half awake What s happened He sees that they are bloody Mamma said At least go and find out what s happening to my daughters even if they ve burned them or murdered them at least bring the corpses He went looking for us At that moment Lyuda was under the bed She says that after they left it seemed that someone was calling her name When he quietly called her she couldn t get out from under the bed She wanted to get out and was calling softly She thought she was shouting but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to herself it just seemed to her that she was shouting When she got out from under the bed everyone was gone And again She thought that she had lost her mind I ll never leave here never To hell with it It just seems that way to me I ll come to eventually But then when everything had settled down stopped that mall brought Lyuda down and Igor carried me in from outside Or first I was brought in then Lyuda I don t remember what order it happened in And Mamma said Listen they re all running around down there shouting something or other and running toward the other building It had more or less calmed down where we were Who s dead who s alive we don t know I tried to call my girlfriend I had basically come to Mamma says Listen let s go upstairs at least get a mattress or something We don t know how long we ll be here Maybe they didn t burn everything I don t get it all women have that feeling they want to get something from their homes maybe not everything was taken I tell Mamma Mamma what do you need any of that for To hell with it We re alive forget the rest of it all of it She says No let s go get at least something Maybe we ll leave here spend the night at someone else s Mamma went upstairs and their little boy their son Alik was standing on the lookout lIe was standing there to see if they were coming They only managed to run up there and grab something one time He shouts Come back they re coming They didn t have enough time to get a lot mattresses from one apartment a blanket from another Mamma got my knitting Someone managed to grab our old things the ones we never wore out of the hall Someone took Father s old coveralls The neighbor his wife Mamma and Papa Marina went with them I was in no condition to leave Neither was Lyuda We just sat They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs they re dragging something again They were going toward the other building maybe over by the school or There was an unfinished building over there people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished building they could gradually carry everything over there Then things more or less calmed down I tried to call my boss Later there was more noise We were on the third floor in a one bedroom apartment and a woman lives in the one bedroom place on the second floor Asya Dallakian She s an old woman retired She wasn t at home at that time she was usually in the country she has a married daughter there and her grandson is in the army She is only very rarely in town she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant They started pounding on her door and broke it down She had two or three beds in there something like that she s a 60 to 70 year old woman who really does not even live there Probably she had some pots a couple of metal bed frames and mattresses and a television When her grandson came she bought a television They started wrecking everything I started getting sick again I think My God what is going on around here When will this end We turned off the lights and sat As it turns out the people who weren t afraid the ones who knew what was going on knew not to turn off the lights We didn t know but they didn t come to where we were all the same They all knew very well that he was a captain He went out and closed the door and we sat in his apartment His last name was Kasumov He s an exserviceman retired works up at the fire station at some plant or other He went out and stood at his door They tell him Comrade Captain don t worry we won t harm you you re one of us He went upstairs and they say Aren t you taking anything from this apartment He says I don t need anything And the women who were standing in the yard we have a basement full of water the women who were standing in the yard saw Those guys they left everything they stole on the first floor and ran upstairs again The women threw everything they had time to into the basement to save our property Some things were left dirty pillows two or three other things and a rug A guy came downstairs really mad and he says Where s the rug I just put it right here They tell him Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school He ran off in that direction Oh I forgot the most important point When Igor picked me up in his arms there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on They just didn t tell me about it for a long time The wife of that military man she didn t want to kill my spirit I was already dead enough Later she told me that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them the ringleader apparently a young man said Where s the girl who was here And he became furious The woman tells him She came to She didn t know what to say Think something up Someone carried her off Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family So the woman says She came to and went to the basement Now our basement is full of water So the whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse They took flashlights they were up to their waists in water water which had been standing there for years and soot and fuel oil They climbed down in there to get me Then one of them said There s so much water down there she probably walked and walked and then passed out and died She met her death in the basement That s it we can leave no problem I didn t know that and when I was told I felt worse Two times worse A lot worse So they didn t just want to pound me flat something more awful was awaiting me After that we of course didn t want to live in Sumgait any longer We really didn t want to go back to our apartment When we moved I went up there and started to quiver and shake all over because I started remembering it all Although the neighbors all sobbed it was all so cheap The people who sat in their apartments and didn t help us at a time like that I think that they could have helped I don t think that they were obligated to but they could have helped us Because that one woman was able to stop that whole brutal crowd by herself That means they could have too It would have been enough foe one man or women to say What do you think you re doing That s all That would have done it There were 60 apartments in our building Not one person said it When I was lying on the ground and all those people were standing on their balconies I didn t hear anyone s voice no one said what are you doing leave her alone Mamma even told one of the neighbor women that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian They would have stood up for one of their own True they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway an old sick woman tried to stop the pogrom The Azerbaijanis have a custom if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground the men are supposed to stop immediately The old woman from the fourth entryway did that but they stomped her scarf into the ground pushed her off to the side and said If you want to go on living you ll disappear into your apartment So she left That trick didn t work on them Even the neighbors who helped us move told me OK fine calm down forget that it happened I said I d only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter and if that didn t have any effect on them then I would forget everything too Imagine that it happened to your sister And no one did anything Anything April 25 1988 Yerevan reference 1 _The Sumgait Tragedy Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan Volume I Eyewitness

who struck terror into the hearts of the Turks Within a few months after the war began these Armenian guerrilla forces operating in close coordination with the Russians were savagely attacking Turkish cities towns and villages in the east massacring their inhabitants without mercy while at the same time working to sabotage the Ottoman army s war effort by destroying roads and bridges raiding caravans and doing whatever else they could to ease Russian occupation The atrocities committed by the Armenian volunteer forces accompanying the Russian army were so severe that the Russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the fighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties The memoirs of many Russian officers who served in the east at this time are filled with accounts of the revolting atrocities committed by these Armenian guerrillas which were savage even by relatively primitive standards of war then observed in such areas 1 1 Journal de Guerre du Deuxieme d Artillerie de Forteresse Russe d Erzeroum 1919 p 28 honored me by reproducing my text Unfortunately he has still not produced the documents on Jews in LATVIA Instead he asks for my views on the Turkish Genocide Well that debate seems to be going on in a few hundred other threads I ll let other people bring the usual charges try to debunk Mutlu Argic Cosar a net wide Terrorism Triangle and their spurious evidence When that does ever happen look out the window to see if there is a non fascist x Soviet Armenian Government in the East Now where is your non existent list of scholars What a moronian During the First World War and the ensuing years 1914 1920 the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic genocide tried to complete its centuries old policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2 5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1 000 year homeland This paragraph is well written and interesting Serdar baby but it has nothing to do with Jews in LATVIA I have not presented a list of scholars How could you Because there is none I am not interested in an ex Soviet why do you write x It s very cute Armenian Government non fascist or otherwise You are not responding to what I am writing Instead you are autoposting your own particular brand of bullshit Like conversing with a brick wall And you are not responding to what I am writing By the way that bullshit is justly regarded as the first instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people For nearly one thousand years the Turkish and Kurdish people lived on their homeland the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation The persecutions culminated in 1914 The Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects 2 5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland After one thousand years Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye Today x Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x Soviet Armenia Today x Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity x Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds You have now done so four times in a row May I legitimately conclude that you are not indeed a regular net user but an auto posting computer program which for convenience I have called MUTLU EXE You may assert whatever you wish Here we go with MUTLU EXE s famed list of sources Ditto The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people This event is incontrovertibly proven by historians government and international political leaders such as U S Ambassador Mark Bristol and on and on for 46 lines And still anxiously awaiting so the list goes on and on and on I m still trying to find out about those Jews in LATVIA Can you post those documents PLEEEEEEEASE Mr Argic Puh leeze could you C mon it s my birthday in three weeks post them for me as a birthday present Remember the issue at hand is the cold blooded genocide of 2 5 million Muslim people by the Armenians between 1914 1920 and the Armenian Nazi collaboration during World War II Anything to add No darling READ what I post Other people are asking you about the Turkish genocide I am asking you to produce the documents on Jews in Latvia No matter how many times you erase what I post I will still post the same question Post the documents on Jews in Latvia Do not autopost the same block of text about the Turkish genocide Remember the issue at hand is the Armenian Nazi collaboration during World War II and the Turkish Genocide And I still fail to see how you can challenge the following western sources Source John Dewey The New Republic Vol 40 Nov 12 1928 pp 268 9 Happy the minority Jews which has had no Christian nation to protect it And one recalls that the Jews took up their abode in fanatic Turkey when they were expelled from Europe especially Spain by Saintly Christians and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects all being exposed alike to the rapacity of their common rulers To one brought up as most Americans have been in the Gladstonian and foreign missionary tradition the condition of the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every nation in the world would have treated as treasonable One readily reaches the conclusion that the Jews in Turkey were fortunate He also stated that they Armenians traitorously turned Turkish cities over to the Russian invader that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war and that they burned at least a hundred Turkish villages and exterminated their population I want the documents of Jews in Latvia I think several other people on soc culture greek are already disputing with you about the Turkish Genocide Is this the joke of the month Who when how where What a clown No sweetie the joke of the month is that you have now posted the same block of text four times but you still have not produced the documents on

an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire Leaving Erivan on April 28 1915 Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the southern side of the lake Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state the Ottoman Empire and to assist instead other invading Russian armies Their hope was their participation in the Russian success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of Ottoman territories Armenian political leaders army officers and common soldiers began deserting in droves With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of World War I the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman s enemy increased drastically Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations who in turn massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading Russian armies Source Stanford J Shaw History of the Ottoman

c run away like the coward without a real address that you are and do not reply to my posts It could be perhaps your head wasn t screwed on just right In 1941 while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration camps the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis In 1943 this battalion had grown into eight battalions of 20 000 strong under the command of the former guerilla leader Dro the butcher who was the former dictator of the short lived Armenian Dictatorship 1918 1920 and the architect of the cold blooded genocide of 2 5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914 1920 An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin which was recognized by the Nazis Encouraged by this the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler s policy of extermination of the Jews This Armenian Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an encore performance staged by the Armenians during WWI when they back stabbed and exterminated 2 5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army Furthermore as McCarthy put it the Armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros Armistice with the Allies October 30 1918 The Allies had decided to create a Greater Armenia including the old Russian province of Yerevan and adjoining areas as well as most parts of Anatolia claimed by the Armenian fanatics Only the area called Cilicia around the Ottoman province of Adana was to be excluded as it had already been claimed by the French The Allies quickly set about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks who could be expected to oppose their plans On April 19 1919 the British Army occupied Kars gave civilian and military power over to the Armenians then withdrew The British planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship even though the Russian pre war census had shown Kars Province to be over 60 Muslim The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed but the British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains The fate of the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in Eastern Anatolia Murder pillage genocide and the destruction of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the Ottoman Army The British had left the scene to the Armenian genocide squads Therefore few Europeans were present to observe the genocide One British soldier Colonel Rawlinson who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of Otoman soldiers saw what was occurring Rawlinson wired to his superiors in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in independent command of the Moslim population as their troops being without discipline and not being under effective control atrocities were constantly being committed Instead you post more Armenian nonsense Come again These European Dashnags with

apart from the destruction suffered during the two year Russian occupation All barracks buildings of Erzincan the cavalry barracks in Erzurum the Government building and Army Corps Headquarters are among those burnt In short both cities are burnt destroyed and trees cut down As to the people of these cities All people old enough to use weapons rounded up taken to the Sarikamis direction for road building and were slaughtered The remaining people were subject to cruelties and murder by Armenians following the withdrawal of Russians and were partly annihilated the corpses thrown into wells burnt in houses mutilated by bayonets their abdomens ripped open in slaughterhouses their lungs and livers torn out girls and women hung up by their hair after all kinds of devilish acts The few people who were able to survive these cruelties worse than those of the Spanish Inquisition are in poverty more dead than alive horrified some driven insane about 1500 in Erzincan and 30 000 in Erzurum The people are hungry and in poverty for whatever they had has been taken away from them their lands left uncultivated The people have just been able to exist with some provisions found in stores left over from the Russians The villages round Erzincan and Erzurum are in the worst condition Some villages on the road have been leveled to the ground leaving no stone the people completely

TATYANA MIKHAILOVNA ARUTUNIAN NEZHINTSEVA Born 1932 Train Conductor Azerbaijani Railroad Resident at Building 13 15 Apartment 27 Microdistrict No 3 Sumgait Azerbaijan I hadn t lived very long in Sumgait only eight years I moved there from Novosibirsk My son entered the Baku Nautical School and so I transferred to Azerbaijan Later I met someone and married him and now my name is Arutunian my husband s name That there would be a massacre was not discussed openly but there were hints and gibes so to speak at the Armenian people and they were mocking the Russians too I was constantly aware of it at work and not just this past year I couldn t find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because I I ll just say it couldn t steal couldn t deceive and couldn t be involved in bribe taking And when I asked for decent working conditions they told me Leave don t keep the others from working you aren t cut out for this kind of work And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at the Armenians like The Turks had it right they killed them all the way they ve multiplied here they re making it hard for us to live and Things will be just fine if we get rid of them all No problem the Turks will help they say if we ask them they ll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an hour Well that s the way it all was but I never thought of course that it would spill over into a bloody tragedy because you just couldn t imagine it Here we ve been living under the Soviet government for 70 years and no one even considered such an idea possible But I had been forming my own opinions and in the presence of authoritative people I would often ask Where is this all leading do people really not see what kind of situation is emerging here The Russians are fleeing Sumgait there are very few of them left Why is no one dealing with this what s going on And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th it became clear that everything had been arranged by someone because what else are you to make of it if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the demonstration with an Azerbaijani flag I wouldn t be saying this now if I hadn t received personal confirmation from him later Because when we were under guard in the SK club on the 1st he came to the club that Muslimzade The women told me There he is there he is that s Muslimzade I didn t believe the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag I thought that they were just false rumors I went over to him and said Are you the First Secretary of our City Party Committee He answers me Yes And I ask him Tell me did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani flag and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs I don t know exactly what they said but there was mention of Armenian blood And he tells me Yes I was there but I tried to dissuade them from it Then I asked him another question And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering us And he said I We didn t know what to do we didn t know we didn t anticipate that that would happen in Sumgait Comrade Mamedov the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani SSR answered the same question for me No we actually didn t anticipate the slaughter in Sumgait At that time we were trying to contain the crowd of 45 000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre Those are his exact words the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the Armenian SSR And now about the events themselves Of course it s painful to discuss them because it may seem that it s not true to someone else Various rumors concerning what happened are making the rounds some are true others aren t But unfortunately there are more true ones than false because it was so horrible in our age here in the space age the age of science the age of progress I don t know if someone had told me this story if I were living in or around Moscow I wouldn t have believed it Why not Because it was really a genocide it was a massacre That s genuinely what it was For example on that day the 28th I didn t know about the 27th because my husband and I were both sick both of us had the flu and we were in bed on the 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says You re in bed You don t know anything about it There was a demonstration in town and after it they were overturning Armenian cars and burning them They were looking into cars and asking Are you an Armenian If they answered in Armenian then they turned the car over and burned it This isn t made up the wife of the Senior Investigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us He was returning home from his dacha with his wife Raisa Sevastyanova she s my neighbor She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the middle of it I don t know what to call it the cavalcade of automobiles they were stopping He answered in Azerbaijani they let them go but they made him honk the horn they were kicking up a fracas We didn t even believe it and I said Certainly that didn t happen how can that be And she said Muslimzade was leading the crowd and the Sputnik store was completely smashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians And when he saw that they had started breaking the glass in that store he said Don t break the shop windows don t destroy state property but do whatever else you want I didn t hear this with my own two ears but it is a fact that the store was torn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians although he s an Azerbaijani While we were talking all of a sudden right across from us Sevastyanova is the first to look out the window and say Look there s a crowd out there And sure enough when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had already started wrecking the neighboring building There was an Armenian family there a woman and two girls They lived across from us I m sorry I don t know the building number or the people s names since we were in my husband s apartment in Microdistrict 8 and I lived in Microdistrict No 3 There was awful looting going on there at the time the most hideous things were going on there then One building there ours was attacked twice once wasn t enough for them They returned to the places where they hadn t finished the Armenians off If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians they beat the Azerbaijanis too They also beat Russians if it was Russians doing the hiding Because there were Russians among them they said so on television there were people of various nationalities But they didn t tell us why there were people of different nationalities Because they wouldn t have touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn t dared to stick up for the Armenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes At the time I saw this from the window I was there Sevastyanova was there and so was my husband We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly off a balcony All kinds of things even a sofa Then when it was all down there they burned it up Then we saw the crowd and they were all oohing At first I couldn t figure out what was happening And later I told my husband Lendrush l think they re beating someone out there And he answered I don t know could be Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment and I saw it and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too My husband had turned the other way he didn t see it I saw a naked girl with her hair down They were dragging her She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her She fell down it was muddy there and later other witnesses who saw it from their balconies told us they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of blocks as far as the mortgage bank that s a good block and a half or two from here I know this for sure because I saw it myself Then the crowd rushed toward our building We were standing there and you can of course imagine what we were feeling Were they going to kill us or not And I also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented that woman because I had just seen that I asked my husband I gave him an axe and said You kill me first and then let them do what they want with the corpse But our neighbors it s true defended us they said There aren t any Armenians in our entryway go away only Muslims live here Disaster missed us that time But at two o clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people approximately came back to our place My husband was already asleep He can sleep when he s upset about something but I can t I was standing running from balcony to balcony Our power was out I don t remember for how long but it was as though it had been deliberately turned off There were no lights whatsoever and I was glad of course I thought it was better that way But then I look and the crowd is at our balcony This was at 2 15 in the morning The first time they were at our building it was 6 30 and now it was 2 15 in the morning But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor the Azerbaijani was awake and watching out there were human beings among them too So she goes out with a pail of garbage as though she needed to be taking garbage out at two o clock in the morning She used it as a pretext and went toward those young people They really were youngsters From my balcony you could see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys They spoke Azerbaijani And when they came up to her she said What do you want And they answered We want the Armenian family that lives here pointing toward the second floor with their hands She says I already told you we don t have any Armenians here now leave do you hear this is an old Muslim woman talking to you and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around her and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away And so they seemed to listen to her They were all very young they started apologizing and left That was the second time death was at our door I forgot to mention about one other apartment a man named Rubik lives there I don t know him really I knew his daughter I mean I saw her around but we really didn t know them But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth floor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight months to earn money Can you imagine what that means He risked his life to earn X amount of money in order to better his family He bought new furniture and was getting ready to give his daughter s hand in marriage but alas everything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels They threw everything out the windows and the rest we saw from our balcony how the neighbors on the left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that hadn t already been smashed or taken What is one to think of that It means that the parents in those families were in on it too Unfortunately I came to be of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been foreseen in advance both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of apartments Something on the order of We ll move the Armenians out and take over their apartments I have worked honestly my whole life you can check everything about me I came as a patriot from China waited for nights on end in front of the Consulate General of the USSR I came to my homeland as a patriot because I knew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things But when I saw in Sumgait that there wasn t anything holy about them that Party membership was bought that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain that there were no ideals no ideas God save me everything was being bought and sold I saw all of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did I can t talk any more about it the image of that beating When I went out of my own apartment they picked us up under Soviet Army guard they had arrived from all over to suppress that gang not only Armenians but some Russian families and their children too came out of their apartments and joined us because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with the situation the way it was And what s interesting is that when we left on the buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people for sure people would basically rise to the situation would have some compassion for the Armenians would somehow understand the injustice of what was done But having analyzed and weighed the whole thing once I calmed down having thought it all through I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people If a lot of Azerbaijanis didn t want their Armenian neighbors to be killed and that basically depended on that Muslimzade he said that he had wanted to calm them down then is it possible that he didn t have people at hand to whom he could whisper at the last minute Go and announce it on television Citizens of Sumgait Take what you can into your hands let s protect our neighbors from this massacre Those crowds weren t such that there was no controlling them Basically they were unarmed They didn t have firearms mostly they had knives they had all kinds of metal parts like armature shafts sharpened at the ends special rocks different to a degree that we noticed them there aren t rocks like those in Sumgait soils they were brought from somewhere as though it were all specially planned So as I was saying I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend us why wasn t it arranged It means that the government didn t want to do it When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik what there was no way of informing Baku No there was no way it turns out The crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict I won t mention the things I didn t see myself I ll only talk about the things I myself witnessed They were in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o clock in the evening when I saw them from the other building and they were somewhere else until mid night or one o clock in the morning because at 2 15 they came back to our building They hadn t completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8 When they returned to our building I told my husband Lendrush now the police are probably going to come my God now the authorities are probably going to find out and come to our aid Well alas no there were to be no authorities not a single policeman not a single fireman not a single ambulance came while they were raging as it turns out as we later found out beginning on the Might of the 27th There were dead people ruined apartments and burned autos one car near the bus station it was burned and overturned it was probably there about four days everyone saw it and what went on in Block 45 Those who live there know they saw from their balconies how they attacked the soldiers in the buses how they beat those poor unarmed soldiers and how on that square I can t remember the name of it where there is that fork coming from the bus station that intersection now I m upset and I can t think of the name there s a tall building there a 9 story and from the balconies there people saw that butchery when the poor soldiers wearing only helmets with shields and those unfortunate clubs moved against that mob And when they fell those 12 to 14 year old boys ran up and using stones big heavy stones beat them to death on their heads Who could have guessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under the Soviet government The upshot is that this republic has not been under Soviet control for a long time but no one wanted to pay any attention or get involved If you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the truth I ve been struggling for truth for five years there already the five years that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad Some people there considered me a demagogue others who knows what some think I m an adventure seeker and some a prankster But I wanted everything to be right I would become outraged how can this be why is it people treat one another this way on a Soviet railroad as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property or the property of some magnate or some mafia If I want to I ll get you out of here If I want to I ll get rid of you If I want to I ll do something else And there s a black market price for everything in the most brazen way a coach to Moscow costs so much a coach on a local train costs so much Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor s pool he had the nerve to tell me maybe you won t even believe this but this I m afraid I heard with my own ears Tatyana just how long can you fight for something that you know will never have any effect You re alone against everyone so instead why don t you give more money to the chief conductor and everything will go fine for you I started to cry turned and left What else could I do where else could I go to complain I realized that everything was useless And the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see it I filed a written complaint and they ground it into dust they destroyed it I still have a copy but what s the use When the General Procuracy got involved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair in addition to the information about what I saw what I was a witness to I gave testimony about the mafia at the railroad They accepted my petition but I don t know if they re going to pursue it or not Because you ll excuse me I no longer believe in the things I aspired to the things I believed in before It s all dead They just spit on my soul stomped on everything physically and most important spiritually because you can lose belongings that s nonsense that all comes with time but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in you your beliefs are destroyed it can be very difficult to restore them I want to tell of one incident I just don t know at the time I was in such a state that I didn t even take minor things into account Here is an example Of course it s not a minor one My neighbor Raisa Sevastyanova she has a son Valery who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8 A boy Vitaly Danielian I don t know his last name goes to school with him or rather went to school with him I was just sitting in an apartment trying to make a phone call to Moscow Oh yes and there s one important detail When the massacre began for two to three hours the phones weren t working in Armenian apartments and later in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments But the fact of the matter is that service was shut off you could not call anywhere Why Again it means it was all planned How come service is cut off for no reason And the lights went off And those brats were raging as they liked They weren t afraid they ran about freely they that no one would slap their hands and no one would dare to stop them They knew it Now I m going to tell about the incident So this little Vitaly Vitalik an Armenian boy went to school with Valery they were in the same class According to what Valery and his neighbor pal said at the time I was in the same apartment as they were I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put through a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived So Valery ran to his mother and said Mamma please let me go to Vitalik s what if they kill him Maybe he s still alive maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow He s a nice guy we all like him he s a good person he s smart His mother wouldn t let him go In tears she says Valery you can t go because I am afraid He says Mamma we can get around the crowd We ll just watch just have a look They made it through I don t know I think Vitalik s parents lived in Microdistrict No 1 and when they got there they made a superficial deduction Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken everywhere that you could see from the street which were the Armenian apartments in the building they went here and there and looked and saw that the windows were intact and so they calmed down But even though the windows in that apartment were not broken everything inside was totally smashed and Vitalik lay there with a broken skull and his mother and father had already been murdered Little Vitalik didn t even know they were dead So two weeks ago I don t know he was in critical condition no maybe it was longer we left Sumgait on March 20 spent some time in Moscow and then we came to Yerevan So it s been about a month already it s so hard to keep all this straight So Valery the next day when he found out that Vitalik s family has been killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku Valery and his classmates got together and went to visit him But they wouldn t admit them telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in a coma They cried and left having also found out that the girl I saw being kicked and dragged was in that hospital too As it turns out she was brought there in serious condition but at least she was alive at the time When we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another throw ourselves into their arms and kiss them because you had wondered if these friends were alive or not if those friends were alive or not And when you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived When you saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end If you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book A book of things it is even difficult to believe And those two girls who were raped were entirely black and blue the ones at the SK they know I m not lying that girlfriend came up to one of them and said What happened and she bared her breasts and they were completely covered in cigarette burns those rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts After something like that I don t know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it Now When we stayed at the military unit for a while they provided well basic conditions for us there The military unit is located in Nasosny some six miles from Sumgait And living there we met with a larger group of people There were about 1 600 people at the unit You know there was a point when I couldn t even go outside because if you went outside you saw so much heartbreak around you And when you hear the false rumors Yes by the way false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians around Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground with bulldozers I didn t know whether to believe it or not And people who don t know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge But when I arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak and in Spitak all those villages are not only intact but at that time had even been protected just in case they were guarded they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak Not a single person there died and no one is planning to harm them Around Yerevan all the villages are safe and unharmed and the Armenians didn t attack anyone But actually after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there could have been a feeling of vengefulness but no one acted on it And I don t know why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are guilty that it is they who organized it Rumors like that are being spread in Azerbaijan And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it they not only perceive it with their minds but with their hearts too To them it seems that the older person is telling the truth For example one says Did you know that out of 31 people killed by the way originally they said 31 people but later they found a 32nd 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an Armenian Of course I m upset but it s utterly impossible to discuss such things and not become upset Sometimes l forget things but I know I want to return to the time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee When I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I couldn t believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner I already mentioned this and if I repeat anything please excuse me I asked him Why did you do that and why are you here now why did you come here To laugh at these women who are strewn about on the floor The overcrowding there was tremendous it was completely unsanitary and several of the children were already sick It s true the troops tried to make it livable for us They cooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food but the thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at it everywhere that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere Plus they were never given any direct orders they didn t know what they were authorized to do and not to do And it was only on March 8 at five o clock in the evening that Krayev himself the Lieutenant General the City Commandant of Sumgait was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored personnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do as his heart advised him and relocate people to the military unit But that s not what I want to talk about now Muslimzade characteristically tried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party Committee which is across the square from the club He took me by the hand and said Citizen don t worry we ll go and have a talk in my office I told him No after everything you ve done I don t believe one iota of what you say If I go to the City Party Committee I ll disappear and the traces of me will disappear too Because you can t stand it when Oh yes and there was another interesting detail from that meeting It was even very funny although at the time I wasn t up to laughing He was in a nice expensive hat and so as to put him to shame so to speak I said Oh why did you come here all duded up like a London dandy you smell of good perfume you re in your starched shirt and you have your expensive hat on You came to ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor who are already getting sick whose relatives have died Did you come to laugh at them And the one who was accompanying him an Azerbaijani I don t know who he was or what his title was he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade s head and hid it Then I said My God We re not marauders We re not you We didn t come to you with the intention of stealing Well kill me kill me Muslimzade says to me But I m not guilty kill me kill me but I m not guilty And I say OK fine you re not guilty have it your way But give us an answer we re asking you Where were you when they were torturing and raping those poor women when they were killing the children burning things carrying on outrageously and wrecking all those apartments Where were you then You know we didn t expect it we did not know what to do we didn t anticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait I started laughing and said It s truly funny He says What could I do We didn t know what to do And I say I m sorry but it ll be ridiculous if I tell you The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn t march out in front with a banner he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross over his dead body That s what you should have done That s the way it was during the war Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself either he died or he led people into battle And what did you do You ran away you left you hid you marched with a flag because you were afraid excuse my language you feared for your own damned hide And when we ask you you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done That s right I told him the City party committee got confused all the party committees got confused the police got confused Baku got confused they all lay in a faint for two weeks and the gang ran the show with impunity And if it weren t for the troops it wouldn t have been just two days there wouldn t be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure they would have finished their bloody affair because they brazenly went up to some Russians too the ones who tried to say something to them and they told them As soon as we finish with the Armenians we ll come after you too And by the way there was a colonel who took us to the military unit He was the one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later arrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the SK and took us to the military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit We asked him What How What will come of us He openly said You know for us the main thing now is to catch that gang We ll finish that quickly You ll stay at the military unit for the time being and we ll decide later The General Procuracy of the USSR arrived it consists of investigators from all cities There were some from Stavropol from everywhere just everywhere because the affair was truly frightful About this by the way Comrade Katusev spoke as everyone knows he s the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR When he gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit by the way he told us the honest truth because he couldn t not say it because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen and he said There was Afghanistan and it was bad but Sumgait it s horrible And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely punished in accordance with our laws And that s a quote Then one mother throws herself at him her two sons had died before her very eyes and says Who will return my sons Who is going to punish the culprits They tried to calm her down and he said In order for us to conduct a proper investigation in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility you must help us because we don t know maybe there was someone else in the gang who is now being concealed in homes and maybe the neighbors know maybe someone saw something Don t be afraid write about it in detail So that you re not afraid Everyone knows that many of you are afraid having lived through such horrors they think that if they write the whole truth about let s say their neighbor or someone else that they will seek revenge later We re going to do it like this We re going to set up an urn and you can throw what you write in there We don t need to know who wrote it The names of the people who write won t be made public but we need all the information Let each and every one not be afraid let each write what is necessary who they saw in that gang who made threats or shouted threatening gibes about the Armenians You must describe all of these people and put the information into the urn Two soldiers and a major guarded the urn And sure enough many people people who didn t even want to write I know one woman who asked me she came up and said You as a Russian the same thing won t happen to you as will happen to me So please I ll give you the information and you please write it down for me So she was afraid and there were a lot like her But later after Katusev made his speech she sat and wrote down everything she knew And we threw it all into the urn Now we don t know if it will be of any use For a factual picture will emerge from all that information One person can lie but thousands can t lie thousands simply can t lie You have to agree with that a fact is a fact Why for example should someone say that black is white if it is really black The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani SSR Mamedov as I said was in Yerevan My husband and I were at the Council of Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present the one who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to return to their previous dwellings to their old apartments We asked for a meeting with him and it was granted When we went to see him he tried to behave properly very politely delicately but when the truth was told right to his face and when I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade Where were you personally when they were beating us Now you re trying to convince us to return why didn t you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where it was all leading he says You re telling the truth Let s not mince words You ve told me right to my face and I ll tell you straight I ll tell you the pure truth I was gotten out of bed in the evening the whole government was up including me and we were restraining a crowd of about 45 000 in Baku But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait with its fine international record such a thing could happen We expected it in Baku I say So that means you expected it all the same Why were you expecting it And he says You know it just happened that way We were expecting it in Baku we were trying to restrain it but in Sumgait I say Fine you didn t know for the first three or four hours but then you should have known Why did no one help us And he says Well OK we didn t know what to do and things like that Basically it was the same story I got from Muslimzade Later when he said You go on back the situation in Sumgait is favorable now everything is fine the Armenians are friendly with the Azerbaijanis To this l answered You know what I m speaking with you as a member of a neutral nation I have never argued with Armenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness You tell me please Comrade Mamedov I asked him What would you say about this honestly if you were being completely frank with us Then he said Yes I admit that I am honestly ashamed shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation we have disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union but before the whole world Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign radio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors too And I say There s nothing to add to what really happened I don t think it s possible to add anything more awful He says Yes I agree with you I understand your pain it is truly an unfortunate occurrence I repeat that he said unfortunate occurrence And then he suddenly remembered himself what he was saying he had a pen in his hands he was fidgeting with it nervously and said Oh excuse me a tragedy really I take this to mean that he really thinks it s an unfortunate occurrence And of course he says I understand that having gone through all this you can t return to Sumgait but it s necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being tried And he even gave a detail which I don t know if it matters or not that 160 policemen were being tried Specifically in relation to that bloody affair Yes by the way there is another good detail how I was set up at work in Baku after the events I went to an undergarment plant there was an Azerbaijani working there and suddenly she tells me What they didn t nail your husband They screwed up I was floored I hadn t imagined that anyone in Baku too could say something like that Well after that I went up to see to my office I needed to find out about those days what was going to happen with them how they were going to put down those days from February 29 to March 10 and the administrator told me I don t know Tatyana go to the head of the conductors pool Be grateful if they don t put it down as unexcused absence I was really discouraged by this They all know that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived and here they re telling me that I was skipping work as though I was off enjoying myself somewhere I went to the office of the chief of the pool his last name is Rasulov and he s had that position for many years Incidentally he s a Party member and is a big man in town And suddenly when I went to him and said Comrade Rasulov this is the way it was He looked at me askance and said And why are you he knows me by my previous last name why did you get wrapped up in this mess I say What do you mean why did I get wrapped up in this mess My husband s an Armenian I tell him I have an Armenian last name And he screwed up his face made a kind of a grimace as though he had eaten something sour and said I didn t expect that you would What did he mean by that And how should he behave the chief of the pool a man who supervises 1 700 workers Now it s true there was a reduction but for sure there are still 1 200 conductors working for him And if someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that then what can you expect from a simple uneducated politically unsophisticated person He s going to believe any and all rumors that the Armenians are like this the Armenians are like that and so on By the way that Mamedov now I m going back to Mamedov s office when I asked him Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return to Sumgait he answered Yes you know I would guarantee them I don t want to take on too much I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years But I won t guarantee them for longer than 50 years I say So you ve got another thing like that planned for 50 years from now So they ll be quiet and then in another 50 years it ll happen again I couldn t contain myself any more and I also told him And how did it get to that point certainly you knew about it how they were treating the Russians for example in Baku and in Sumgait how they were hounded from their jobs Certainly you received complaints I wrote some myself Why did no one respond to them Why did everyone ignore what was going on Didn t you prepare people for this by the way you treated them And he says You know you re finally starting to insult me He threw his pen on the desk Maybe now you ll say I m a scoundrel too I say You know I m not talking about you because I don t know But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction yes that comrade was involved in this that and that because I know for certain Well anyway he assured us that here in Yerevan there were false rumors that 3 000 Sumgait Armenians were here and 15 000 were in Sumgait and had gotten back to work Everyone was working he said and life was very good We drove about the town ourselves Comrade Arutiunian First Secretary of the Communist Party of Armenia SSR came from the Council of Ministers of Armenian he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in Sumgait When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said Well I walked down the street And I said Walking down the street in any city even if I were to go to New York I would never understand the situation because I would be a guest I don t have any contact with people but if you spend 10 days among some blue collar workers in such a way that they didn t know you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers you d hear something quite different I told him for example that I drew my conclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments They took us all in turns to pick things up since people had fled to the military unit they got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible How are the neighbors in the microdistrict how will they view us what do they think I thought maybe that in fact it wasn t something general of a mass nature some anti national something And when that bus took us to our building because it was the same bus while we were going up to our apartment an armed soldier accompanied us What does that say It speaks of the fact that if everything there were fine why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with us going from apartment to apartment And in fact especially with the young people you could sense the delight at our misfortune the grins and they were making comments too And that was in the presence of troops when police detachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and tanks were passing by And if people are taking such malicious delight when the situation is like that then what is it going to be like when they withdraw protection from the city altogether There will be more outrages of course perhaps not organized but in the alleys April 20 1988 Yerevan reference 1 _The Sumgait Tragedy Pogroms against

on a desert with blue sky background The size is just right for centered wallpaper on a 1024x768 display because it leaves a border at the bottom just big enough for icons to fit in without being on top of the picture Reguarding image quality and resolution I have not seen much better For those of you who haven t worked with pieced image files here is how to put it back together 1 save the 14 parts to 14 individual files 2 use a text editor to remove the header and footer in each file 3 concatinate all the parts into a single file 4 uudecode the file There are tools available to do this

everybody I guess my subject has said it all It is getting boring looking at those same old bmp files that came with Windows So I am wondering if there is any body has some beautiful bmp file I can share Or maybe somebody can tell me some ftp site for some bmp files like some scenery files some animals files etc I used to have some unfortunately i delete them all Anyway could me give me some help please In response to a different kinda wallpaper here s what I use I think the original gif whatever was called not_real The artist name and logo is in the lower right corner You will need VGA I

If the state was to be exclusive it would not have 400 000 arab citizens And no I do not consider the purchase of land a hostile action When someone wants to buy land and someone else is willing to

can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling IBM You can do so only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori Clearly the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality Being a multi ethnic multi religious society accepting the jews as neighbours was no different just another religion Plus they paid fair market value etc They did not

Final Solution for Gaza Final Solution for the Gaza ghetto While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto they repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and attempt to starve the Gazans Your comparison with the Warsaw Ghetto uprising is insulting and racist beyond belief The attempts to quiet any violence in the Gaza Strip are just that The efforts to quell murder and mayhem in the Gaza strip were the resluts of violence and came AFTER the violence It was not an arbitrary racial move like the nazi treatment of Jews Jews had NOT committed acts of violence and murder as have the residents of Gaza I find your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than anti Israel bigotry The Gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population density in the world has been cut off from the world for weeks The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of Gaza some 700 000 people by denying them the right to leave the strip and seek work in Israel It is NOT punishment but protection from repeated attacks by residents of Gaza You self servingly omit any references to WHY Israel has had to take action Apparaently the deaths of innocent Israeli civilians do not enter into your equation a racist ommission on your part While Polish non Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the Ghetto no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help the Gazan resistance The only help given to Gazans by Israeli Jews only dozens of people is humanitarian assistance The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of justice A population denied basic human rights is entitled to rise up against its tormentors The right of Israel to protect its citizens from murderers is also recognized by international law Israeli civilians have been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis If this wave of murder does not matter to you then your posturing for the basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing but an anti Israel charade As is known the Israeli regime is considering Gazans unworthy of Israeli citizenship and equal rights in Israel although they are considered worthy to do the dirty work in Israeli hotels shops and fields Do you know of residents of Gaza who have applied for Israeli citizenship and were denied I have heard of no such denials taking place Can you document this or is this more of your stupid and innacurate propaganda The truth is that if Gazan residents applied for citizenship HAMAS would murder them as collaborators Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in Israel They may not live there for these areas are reserved for the Master Race How dare you use such a disgusting phrase How very easy you attack a people when you omit facts which fly in the face of your pure racism Perhaps you are judging a people to be the racists that you are Do you believe that all Jews must have the same bigoted makeup as you Here s another little fly in your ointment about the master race for you to avoid Two months ago a plane with 86 Bosnian Muslims left Bosnia to seek asylum in the middle east Four Arab nations refused to grant them asylum Then when Israli Arabs agreed to take the responsibility for them they were allowed into Israel Yes Israel But when the plane landed the Israeli Arabs who had previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved with the rescue project because they felt that it would make Israel look good It was more important to avoid any good PR for Israel than to take care of fellow Muslims Israel moved them to a kibbutz where they are safe and secure The truth is that time after time the Islamic world has turned its back on Muslims in need more than Israel has Even in the case of the 400 deportees Lebanon was willing to let their so called Arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary in Lebanon Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait just because they were Palestinian The truth is that your phoney concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an excuse to attack Israel You are part of the ignorant effort to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to attacking Israel But the truth is there are greater reasons than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians To disregard Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oil rich nations who do nothing for these people is to use the plight of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews or your hatred of Israel Anti semitism and anti Zionism is NOT the same as pro Palestinian and anyone who insists that it is the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare The Nazi regime accorded to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto the right to self administration They selected Jews to pacify the occupied population and preventing any form of resistance Some Jewish collaborators were killed Israel also wishes to rule over Gaza through Arab collaborators Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your racism cannot be disguised Jews had never declared war on a Polish people Jews had never attacked Poles with knives or had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks To take something like the Warsaw Ghetto the creation of which you do not even bother to discuss and the uprising that followed is to degrade the dead and to show that intelligent debate on a difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview You clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of the Islamic Resistance Movement Here is arguably the single most anti semitic genocidal document since Mein Kampf yet it is totally disregarded in your rantings Your racism is most evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation If it were considered you might actually have to deal with mideast problems in a balanced manner rather than in an anti semitic manner As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible with basic human rights and international law that of becoming Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for self determination it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish society does not consider Gazans full human beings And just how was Gaza obtained Do you forget that Israel is not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it but had taken Gaza in a war that it did not start Did you know land Israel captures in wars wars which other nations have ALWAYS started aren t the same as Israel and they are subject to a completely different set of international laws Since you do continuously refer to international law would you please say what specific international laws Israel is violating This attitude is consistent with the attitude of the Nazis towards Jews I can cite 6 000 000 reasons why it is not The current policies by the Israeli government of cutting off Gaza are consistent with the wish publicly expressed by Prime Mininister Yitzhak Rabin that Gaza sink into the sea Where is this quote I have never heard Rabin assert that he wished such a thing Since you are in general a liar you ll have to provide the entire quote with source or this effort will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications One is led to ask oneself whether Israeli leaders entertain still more sinister goals towards the Gazans Whether they have some Final Solution up their sleeve Only you are led to ask such a loaded racist intellectually dishonest question You inability to come to terms with what you are has turned you into a racist of the highest order I urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever they can to help the Gazans regain their full human civil and political rights to which they are entitled as human beings Why do you not feel the same compassion for the Jews of Iran or Iraq or Yemen or Saudi Arabia or Syria Do you have an inkling of what they have endured over the past decades Or what about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait Or what about the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims Do you think the residents of Gaza are being subjected to what all the Muslims in Bosnia are enduring Why are you indifferent to the death and suffering of people Why do you not care that these folk are being exterminated Why do you not care that only Israel has given any of these people safe haven Could it be due to the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing The people in Gaza are not being exterminated They aren t being killed They aren t being raped They aren t being starved They aren t being driven from their lands They are not kept from receiving food or other supplies But the Bosnians are And the ONLY country which has provided some sanctuary to the Bosnian Muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your life to attacking in the guise of compassion Your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself what your real motives are Do not flatter yourself into the belief that truth or compassion are what drives you In your case it is clear that hate beats out love every time Maybe you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born a Jew It is obvious that your hatred of your own Judaism is being dumped on all other Jews Why else would you suggest a racist idea like breeding Jews out of existence Maybe these fits of anti semitism are a result of being cut off from your own people for an extended period Whatever the case may be it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to appear to be When you realize that you can t care for other people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do some good But for now you are a fruad']"

removed the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children So basically all I m left with is toughing out the pain This would be impossible without Naprosyn or something similar but not aspirin that doesn t work and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago so I m through with it In fact Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain and pain in both legs as I ll discuss in a moment Generally though I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain it s actually quite effective at reducing the pain it just takes quite a while In the meantime I m frequently in severe pain The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy I ve had MRIs Xrays CT scan and EMGs I ve had 2 of them and don t intend to ever do that again with nerve conduction tests The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain The MRI reports both say I have several bulging degeneratig disks and from the Xrays and MRI I think it is apparent that I have arthritis The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations L3 L4 and L4 L5 but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG Oh yeah I had some other horrible test called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the internal nerves are working fine Anyway the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain The back pain is there all the time but I can live with it When the leg pain is there I need some analgesic anti inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6 9 months every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse so I d always resume Since last November I have taken it much less frequently and primarily for the pelvic pain I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months 2 3 times a week After the first month or so my therapist put me on pelvic traction she had tried it earlier but it had caused a lot of pain in my back this time she tried it at a lower weight After a month or two the pain in my legs began going away but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage So now I don t have nearly as much pain in my legs in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago Getting back to my original reason for this post Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches I really can t avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources that force me to use them Oh I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery but I m avoiding that too I find the migraines difficult to deal with occassionally I have to take off work but usually I can work but at a reduced capacity I m a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing When the pelvic pain is bad I can t concentrate much I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes because the pain is so bothersome When the pain in my back is bad it can cause severe burning in both legs shooting pains in my legs electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes and basically when it gets bad I can t really sit at all Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources I get a lot of migraines an average of 3 to 4 a month which last 1 3 days I ve taken cafergot the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage but I don t like the side effects if I take more than two I get diahrea If I get a very bad headache I will eventually take the cafergot My neurologist wasn t very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot he said that when sumatriptan becomes available I should try that I ve tried several other medications fiornal midrin fiornal with codeine tegretol and inderal but they either didn t work or I couldn t tolerate them So what can I do My doctor s seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain which I agree with most of the time but not when I have a lot of pain I ve had some bad experiences with surgery my heart stopped once from the anesthesia I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine and I ve already had surgery several times Anyway the point of what I m saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain Janice Rathmann', 'From David Dodell Subject HICN610 Medical News Part 3 4 Reply To David Dodell Distribution world

28 Volume 6 Number 10 April 20 1993 Articles LOW LEVELS OF AIRBORNE PARTICLES LINKED TO SERIOUS ASTHMA ATTACKS American Lung Association A new study published by the American Lung Association has shown that surprisingly low concentrations of airborne particles can send people with asthma rushing to emergency rooms for treatment The Seattle based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed unsafe under federal air quality laws People with asthma have inflamed airways and airborne particles tend to exacerbate that inflammation said Joel Schwartz Ph D of the Environmental Protection Agency who was the lead author of the study When people are on the threshold of having a serious asthma attack particles can push them over the edge The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits with daily levels of PM or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns or less These finer particles are considered hazardous because they are small enough penetrate into the lung Cities are considered out of compliance with clean air laws if the 24 hour average concentration of PM10 exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air In Seattle however a link between fine particles and asthma was found at levels as low as 30 micrograms The authors concluded that for every 30 microgram increase in the four day average of PM10 the odds of someone with asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory Disease an official journal of the American Thoracic Society the Lung Association s medical section The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat A 1992 study by Dr Schwartz and Douglas Dockery Ph D of Harvard found that particles may be causing roughly 60 000 premature deaths each year in the United States Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms and bronchitis in children Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone says Dr Schwartz But more and more research is showing that particles are bad actors as well One problem in setting standards for particulate air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study Unlike other regulated pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide particulate matter is a complex and varying mixture of substances including carbon hydrocarbons dust and HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 29 Volume 6 Number 10 April 20 1993 acid aerosols Researchers can t Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects of particulate air pollution says Dr Schwartz We have no way of duplicating the typical urban mix of particles Consequently most of what is known about particulates has been learned through population based research like the Seattle study Given that the EPA s current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur dioxide standards the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any time soon Until changes are made there appears to be little people with asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles In some areas you can get reports on air quality but the reports only cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard and that s rarely particulate matter says Dr Schwartz However PM10 doesn t have to be near its violation range to be unhealthy HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 30 Volume 6 Number 10 April 20 1993 NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on Diagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in dermatology pathology epidemiology public education surveillance techniques and potential new technologies as well as other health care professionals and the public to address 1 the clinical and histological characteristics of early melanoma 2 the appropriate diagnosis management and followup of patients with early melanoma 3 the role of dysplastic nevi and their significance and 4 the role of education and screening in preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality Following 2 days of presentations by experts and discussion by the audience a consensus panel weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement Among their findings the panel recommended that 1 melanoma in situ is a distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0 5 centimeter margins 2 thin invasive melanoma less than 1 millimeter thick has the potential for long term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical excision with a 1 centimeter margin 3 elective lymph node dissections and extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma 4 patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely 5 some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs and 6 education and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality from melanoma A copy of the full text of the consensus panel s statement is available by calling the NIH

Medical Newsletter Page 31 Volume 6 Number 10 April 20 1993 NCI Designated Cancer Centers The Cancer Centers Program is comprised of 55 NCI designated Cancer Centers actively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer incidence morbidity and mortality Within the program there are four types of cancer centers basic science cancer centers 14 which engage primarily in basic cancer research clinical cancer centers 12 which focus on clinical research comprehensive cancer centers 28 which emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to cancer research patient care and community outreach and consortium cancer centers 1 which specialize in cancer prevention and control research Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s it was the National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new cancer centers as well as continuing support for existing ones The passage of the act also dramatically transformed the centers structure and broadened the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic clinical and cancer control research Over the next two decades the centers program grew progressively In 1990 there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation Today there are 28 of these institutions all of which meet specific NCI criteria for comprehensive status To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center an institution must pass rigorous peer review Under guidelines newly established in 1990 the eight criteria for comprehensiveness include the requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in several scientific fields such as biology and molecular genetics a strong program of clinical research and an ability to transfer research findings into clinical practice Moreover five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant also referred to as a P30 or core grant the mechanism of choice for supporting the infrastructure of a cancer center s operations These criteria encompass strong participation in NCI designated high priority clinical trials significant levels of cancer prevention and control research and important outreach and educational activities all of which are funded by a variety of sources The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit important new findings or address timely research questions HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 32 Volume 6 Number 10 April 20 1993 Of the 55 NCI designated Cancer Centers 14 are of the basic science type These centers engage almost entirely in basic research although some centers engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications from new discoveries in the laboratory Clinical cancer centers in contrast focus on both basic research and clinical research within the same institutional framework and frequently incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their overall research programs There are 12 such centers today Finally consortium cancer centers of which there is one are uniquely structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and control research These centers interface with state and local public health departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions responsible for implementing population wide public health programs Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials Together the 55 NCI Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research and through interdisciplinary efforts to effectively move this research from the laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice Comprehensive Cancer Centers

multiple AIDS vaccines instead of only allowing the Army to test a single vaccine administration sources said Thursday The decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to test a vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc and the National Institutes of Health which contended that multiple vaccines should be tested Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement on the therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last Friday Companies including Genentech Inc Chiron Corp and Immuno AG have already told NIH that they are prepared to participate in the vaccine tests The testing is intended to demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the replication of HIV in patients already infected Shalala refuted last week s reports that the Clinton administration had decided the Army s test of the MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time The report was inaccurate and I expect there to be some announcement in the next 24 hours about that particular AIDS research project said Shalala Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director Dr Bernadine Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had convinced the White House that multiple vaccines should be tested simultaneously But MicroGeneSys president Frank Volvovitz said a test of multiple vaccines could triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two years HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 41 Volume 6 Number 10 April 20 1993 The Limits of AZT s Impact on HIV U S News World Report 04 12

Distribution world Organization The Hebrew University of Jerusalem Lines 134 In article Center for Policy Research writes From Center for Policy Research cpr Subject Ten questions about Israel Ten questions to Israelis I would be thankful if any of you who live in Israel could help to provide accurate answers to the following specific questions These are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by people around me 1 Is it true that the Israeli authorities don t recognize Israeli nationality And that ID cards which Israeli citizens must carry at all times identify people as Jews or Arabs not as Israelis Although the Hebrew expression LE UM is used the ID card specifically states on the 2nd page EZRACHUT YISREALIT Israeli citizen This is true for all Israeli citizens no matter what their ethnicity In the United States most official forms have RACE Caucasian Black AmerIndian etc 2 Is it true that the State of Israel has no fixed borders and that Israeli governments from 1948 until today have refused to state where the ultimate borders of the State of Israel should be Funny I have a number of maps and ALL of them have fixed borders 3 Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons If so could you provide any evidence Probably yes So what 4 Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets Apart from Mordechai Vanunu who had a trial behind closed doors there was one other espionage case the nutty professor at the Nes Ziona Biological Institute who was a K G B mole who was tried in camera I wouldn t exactly call it a state secret The trial was simply tried behind closed doors I hate to disappoint you but the United States has tried a number of espionage cases in camera 5 Is it true that Jews who reside in the occupied territories are subject to different laws than non Jews Not Jews Israeli citizens Jordanian law is in effect in the West Bank but the KNESSET passed a law that Israeli law would be binding on Israeli citizens residing in the West Bank These citizens could be Jews Israeli Muslims Druze or Israeli Christians It has NOTHING to do with religion 6 Is it true that Jews who left Palestine in the war 1947 48 to avoid the war were automatically allowed to return while their Christian neighbors who did the same were not allowed to return Anyone who was registered Jew Muslim Christian could return You might be confusing this with the census taken in June 1967 on the West Bank after the Six Day War In this instance if the Arab was not physically present he couldn t reside on the West Bank e g if he had been visting Jordan 7 Is it true that Israel s Prime Minister Y Rabin signed an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948 as is done today in Bosnia Herzegovina No Not even if you drowned him in bourbon scotch or brandy 8 Is it true that Israeli Arab citizens are not admitted as members in kibbutzim Not true Although a minority there are some Israeli Arabs living on kibbutzim On the other hand at my age 42 I wouldn t be admitted to a kibbutz nor could the family join me Not that I would be so thrilled to do so in the first place The kibbbutz movement places candidates under rigorous membership criteria Many Israeli Jews are not admitted 9 Is it true that Israeli law attempts to discourage marriages between Jews and non Jews The religious status quo in Israel has marriage and divorce handled by the religious courts The RABBANUT handles marriage and divorce for Jews the Muslim SHAARIA courts are for Muslims the Christian denominations have their religious courts and the Druze have their own courts The entire religious establishment Jewish Muslim Druze Christian wants to keep it that way 10 Is it true that Hotel Hilton in Tel Aviv is built on the site of a muslim cemetery I believe it s adjacent to a former Muslim cemetary From what I heard and I d like to get feedback from Muslins on the net sanctity of cemetaries is not held that sancrosanct as it is held by Jews The current Israeli Ministry of Trade and Industry on Agron Road in Jerusalem is

permanent or temporary for several months I am interested in the faster Mathcad 4 0 but I am concerned about reported swap file requirements and the legitimacy of Mathsoft s claim about increased speed TO 386SX USERS Will Mathcad 4 0 run without a swap file or insist that I use a swap file So far in response to a less detailed description of my setup or in unrelated postings the more informed answers on the net or by E mail appear to be 1 by David A Fuess According to Mathsoft no Mathcad uses the swap file extensively so as not to overburden the physical resources They say this is actually a win32s feature A figure of 10MB was indicated to me as a minimum But you might try anyway 2 by Bert Tyler I m not all that certain that Mathcad is the culprit here I have a 486 66DX2 with 16MB of main memory less 2MB for a RAMdisk and a bit for a DOS session that is opened as part of the startup process which I have been running without any swapfile When I installed the WIN32s subsystem from

or virtual just to load again due to the win32s libraries So it seems that in addition to the system requirements shown on Mathsoft s advertisement for 4 0 that you need a swap file possibly as big as 12MB Looks like I would just need an 8MB swap file and would need to choose or can I between a faster permanent swap file or a slower temporary swap file Apparently a Win32 subsystem ships with Mathcad 4 0 how much disk space does this require I also received these answers 1 by Dale Hample If you ve got 16 megs of RAM why not configure 10megs as a ram disk for Mathcad DOS 6 permits different bootup configurations Can Mathcad 4 0 Win32 be configured to use such a RAM drive instead of a swap file If not I don t see how using DOS 6 0 for an alternate bootup would provide Windows with this swap file Some time back I remember a discussion about the issues of using a RAM drive to support a swap file but I thought this involved slower 8MB systems I have DOS 6 0 but for various reasons have not yet done a full installation By the way is a full installation of DOS 6 0 required to avail oneself of the alternate bootup feature Which files from the installation disks are required 2 by Wildstrom Presumeably you mean without a _permanent_ swap file If Windows needs a swap file it will upo and create one if a permanent one doesn t exist Permanent is generally faster though I don t know why Mathcad wouldn t be happy with either type Ver 3 0 is and so should any program conforming to the Win specification So far 16MB has been enough RAM to avoid the overhead of running ANY swap

Banko writes While running the MS Quick C compiler in a DOS window under Windows 3 1 this evening I got a program has violated system integrity close all applications exit windows and restart your computer error Gawd I love Windows 1 Is there an easy way to restore everything to working order What might be some better approaches You ll probably want to delete any damaged executables and reload them fresh Data files should be examined and repaired 2 What might have caused this Does the SMARTDRV cache make me more vulnerable I m suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they cache data writing You re not stupid Smartdrive caches things and Windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also All of this is pretty risky stuff in a PC environment The straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the f option to fix the disk and then it looks like I would probably have to reinstall Windows and a few other things A reasonably accurate prediction Here s a brief description of how DOS stores files There are three pieces to a file The directory entry the FAT chain and the data area You can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper a sheet of graph paper and a stack of 3X5 cards The directory entry notebook paper holds the file name actual size and first cluster number It also holds some other information that s not important right now The File Allocation Table FAT chain graph paper tells where to find the actual data Each square of graph paper holds a number If the number is zero the cluster associated with this box is available If it holds a magic number it is either the last piece of a file or a bad unuseable spot on the disk Any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file The data area 3X5 cards is where the actual information is stored The data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size storage is doled out in chunks of one cluster each In your case one cluster is 2048 bytes As a cluster is filled another is allocated To read a file you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number Now you read the data from that cluster Next look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read This will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file Naturally these numbers are usually sequential but they can jump around and even go backwards Continue reading one cluster at a time as you walk this chain through the FAT until you hit the marker which says it s the last cluster in the file CHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into submission It doesn t have any intelligence so you have to double check anything it fixes Now let s do a bit of a post mortem C FX PIC46 VPIC EXE C FX PIC46 PIC TXT C FX PIC46 IDEO7 CFG C FX PIC46 RCPRO2 CFG C FX PIC46 GA CFG C AME OOSE IRD2 X C INMISC DV21 INADV EXE Allocation error size adjusted All of these files have sizes according to the FAT which don t match the size reported in their directory entries CHKDSK F will alter the directory entries to match the FAT size In other words the directory entry for CVPIC EXE may say the file is 64 877 bytes long But CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it My numbers obviously are made up 316 lost allocation units found in 224 chains 647168 bytes disk space would be freed Disk space was found which is allocated in the FAT but is not attached to any directory entry CHKDSK F gives you the option of converting these lost chains to files You can then examine the files FILE0000 CHK through FILE0223 CHK and rename or discard them Or if you tell CHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files then those clusters will simply be marked available in the FAT C FX PIC46 VPIC EXE Is cross linked on allocation unit 16133 C 386SPART PAR Is cross linked on allocation unit 16133 These files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster Obviously one of them at least must be wrong It s interesting to note that C 386SPART PAR is your Windows swap file To fix this you should copy each cross linked file to a new name This will fix the cross link by giving the files unique data spaces Now delete the cross linked files Examine the copies and try to assemble them properly Good luck Hint Missing pieces are likely to be found in those lost chains at the top 42366976 bytes total disk space 3958784 bytes in 4 hidden files 153600 bytes in 67 directories 36042752 bytes in 1496 user files 1564672 bytes available on disk Your disk is pretty close to full This may be the actual cause of the problem perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space In any case the short summary is that something trashed your FAT There are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage after something like this but you have to run them _before_ the problem occurs Sorry Gordon S Hlavenka Vote straight ticket Procrastination party Dec 3rd Gordon

drive To make things compatable I removed my Permanent swap file before starting the upgrade However when all the dust settled and I go into windows it says that the temporary swap file is right where it always was in the Windows directory My question is How come the temporary swap files works OK with a compressed drive and the permanent one doesn t you might want to look in windows FAQ for this one but here is my best explanation But I can t guarantee that I m not way off base The permenant swap file is read written to by windows by talking directly to the hard disk controller card The controller card must use the protocal set up by western digital or something like that Windows creates a file called spart par in your windows directory that points to that file It then uses the physical information about your disk to index to information in that file compressed disks are actually logical disks These disks have different characteristics than the actual physical disk Furthermore the information on the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used i e it must go through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating system level or the BIOS level Because of this inbetween program windows cannot use direct methods to read from the logical disk a permenant swap file is only there to reserve an area of the disk that windows can use and to block that space from DOS Windows would theoretically not even have to access the file from DOS to use that disk space I don t know if it does or doesn t but it checks for it somewhere everytime you boot windows a temporary swap file is just a normal DOS file that is accessed by windows via DOS and the BIOS If a disk compression program or other TSR is loaded the file access must go through DOS TSR S disk compression and BIOS in order to be access i e NEVER USE A TEMPORARY SWAP FILE NEVER more on permenent swap files i m sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk has seen the message you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested size windows will only use the size suggested do you wan t to create this swap file anyway or something like that well a friend of mine ROBERT called microsoft and asked them what and why what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and divides that number by 2 Then it checks for the largest contiguous block of free disk space Windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers They also said that under absolutely no circumstances NONE will windows uses a swap file larger than the suggested size Well that s what he said I call If this is true why does windows report the memory is available to me if it s not going to use it any takers James if this doesn t get to the net

as I understand a muslim The fact that he s a British citizen does not preclude his being muslim Rushdie was an atheist to use local terminology not to put words in his mouth at the time of writing TSV and at the time of the fatwa in February 1989 Well if he was born muslim I am fairly certain he was then he _is_ muslim until he explicitly renounces Islam So far as I know he has never explicitly renounced Islam though he may have been in extreme doubt about the existence of God Being muslim is a legal as well as intellectual issue according to Islam To put it as simply as possible I am not a Muslim I do not accept the charge of apostacy because I have never in my adult life affirmed any belief and what one has not affirmed one can not be said to have apostasized from The Islam I know states clearly that there can be no coercion in matters of religion The many Muslims I respect would be horrified by the idea that they belong to their faith purely by virtue of birth and that a person who freely chose not to be a Muslim could therefore be put to death Salman Rushdie In Good Faith 1990 God Satan Paradise and Hell all vanished one day in my fifteenth year when I quite abruptly lost my faith and afterwards to prove my new found atheism I bought myself a rather tasteless ham sandwich and so partook for the first time of the forbidden flesh of the swine No thunderbolt arrived

Khomeini I know there are fanatics and fringe elements in all religions but even apparently moderate Muslims have participated or refused to distance themselves from the witch hunt against Rushdie Yes I think this is true but there Khomenei s motivations are quite irrelevant to the issue The fact of the matter is that Rushdie made false statements fiction I know but where is the line between fact and fiction about the life of Mohammad Only a functional illiterate with absolutely no conception of the nature of the novel could think such a thing I ll accept it reluctantly from mobs in Pakistan but not from you What is presented in the fictional dream of a demented character cannot by the wildest stretch of the imagination be considered a reflection on the actual Mohammad What s worse the novel doesn t present the Mahound Mohammed character in any worse light than secular histories of Islam in particular there is no lewd misrepresentation of his life or that of his wives That is why few people rush to his defense he s considered an absolute fool for his writings in _The Satanic Verses_ Don t hold back he s considered an apostate and a blasphemer However it s not for his writing in _The Satanic Verses_ but for what people have accepted as a propagandistic version of what is contained in that book I have yet to find one single muslim who has convinced me that they have read the book Some have initially claimed to have done so but none has shown more knowledge of the book than a superficial Newsweek story might impart and all have made factual misstatements about events

not according to you necessarily be practicing true Islam but the danger still remains one cannot blame failure to publically renounce Islam on laziness as opposed to a desire to stay alive and well Of course if you re planning to pull a Rushdie then declaring one s leaving the religion is little to be concerned about compared to one s other plans In Rushdie s case the one under discussion one can It is tragic that in _some_ Islamic countries this is so There are however Islamic countries whose constitutions contains statements that Islamic law is to be incorporated e g Kuwait where one can freely make such statements without fear Not to mention that it has already been pointed out that Rushdie has said in his books that he s not a Muslim and there have surely been enough readers of his books to provide the appropriate number of witnesses This story has become tiresome The conditions are clear If you care to make your point clear then make a chronology and show that he had made public statements about leaving Islam prior to his writing of _TSV_ If he did make such statements then he should have made _that_ clear rather than trying to rejoin Islam or go on talking about his

Islamic law that the sentence was only applicable where the jurisdiction of Islamic law applies Moreover the sentence has to be passed by an Islamic court and executed by the state machinery through the due process of the law Even in Islamic countries let alone in non Muslim lands individuals cannot take the law into their own hands The sentence when passed must be carried out by the state through the usual machinery and not by individuals Indeed it becomes a criminal act to take the law into one s own hands and punish the offender unless it is in the process of self defence Moreover the offender must be brought to the notice of the court and it is the court who shoud decide how to deal with him This law applies equally to Muslim as well as non Muslim territories I agree fully with the above statement and is precisely what I meant by my previous statements about Islam not being anarchist and the law not being _enforcible_ despite the _law_ being applicable Hence on such clarification from the ulama Islamic scholars Muslims in Britain before and after Imam Khomeini s fatwa made it very clear that since Islamic law is not applicable to Britain the hadd compulsory punishment cannot be applied here I disagree with this conclusion about the _applicability_ of the Islamic law to all muslims wherever they may be The above conclusion does not strictly follow from the foregoing but only the conclusion that the fatwa cannot be enforced according to Islamic law However I do agree that the punishment cannot be applied to Rushdie even were it well founded Wow from the above it looks like that from an Islamic viewpoint Khomeini s fatwa constitutes a criminal act perhaps I could even go out on a limb and call Khomeini a criminal on this basis Certainly putting a price on the head of Rushdie in Britain is a criminal act according to Islamic law Anyhow I think it is understood by _knowledgeable_ Muslims that Khomeini s fatwa is Islamically illegitimate at least on the basis expounded above Others such as myself and others who have posted here particularly Umar Khan and Gregg Jaeger I think go further and say that even the punishment constituted in the fatwa is against Islamic law according to our understanding Yes Gregg']"

amounts added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be encountered in a ny single food By eating lots of junk food packaged soups and diet soft drinks it is possible to jack your

OPIRG writes Maybe you missed it amidst the flurry of responses You mean the responses some of which pointed to double blind tests which show no such chinese restaurant effect unique to MSG it s elicited by the placebo as well Many people responded with more anecdotal stories I think its safe to say the original poster is already familiar with such stories Presumably he wants hard info to substantiate or refute claims about MSG making people ill Similarly debunking such claims without doing research whether literature and lab is equally beside the point The original poster no doubt already knows that some people think Chinese Restaurant Syndrome is bogus Placebos are all very interesting but irrelevant to the question of what effects MSG has You could have real effects and placebo effects people may have allergies in addition Yet again the use of this newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters they have substantial knowledge of Like youself Someone who can read a scientific paper and apparently come away from it with bizarrely cracked ideas which have nothing to do with the use of this substance in human nutrition Have you read Olney s work I fail to see how citing results from peer reviewed studies qualifies as bizarrely cracked For cites on MSG look up almost anything by John W Olney a toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on development It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an excitotoxic food additive No it s undisputed in the literature that glutamate is an amino acid which is an excitatory neurotransmitter There is also evidence that excessive release of glutamate may be involved in the pathology of certain conditions like stroke drowning and Lou Gehrig s disease just to name a few This is a completely different issue than the use of this ubiquitous amino acid in foods People are not receiving intra ventricular injections of glutamate Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys as well I have never seen a study where the mode of administration was intra ventricular The Glu and Asp were administered orally Some studies used IV and SC Intra ventricular is not a normal admin method for food tox studies for obvious reasons You must not have read the peer reviewed works that I referred to or you would never have come up with this brain injection bunk Too much in the diet and the system gets thrown off Sez you Such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any controlled studies Infant mice and other models are useful as far as they go but they re not relevant to the matter at hand Which is not to say that I favor its use in things like baby food a patently ridiculous use of the additive But we have no reason to believe that MSG in the diet effects humans adversely Pardon me but where are you getting this from Have you read the journals Have you done a thorough literature search But you re right mice aren t the best to study this on They re four times less sensitive than humans to MSG Glutamate and aspartate also an excitotoxin are necessary in small amounts and are freely available in many foods but the amounts added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be encountered in a ny single food Wrong Do you know how much aspartate or phenylalanine is in a soft drink Milligrams worth Compare that to a glass of milk Do you know how much glutamate is present in most protein containing foods compared to that added by the use of MSG The point is exceeding the window Of course they re amino acids Note that people with PKU cannot tolerate any phenylalanine Olney s research compared infant human diets Specifically the amount of freely available Glu in mother s milk versus commercial baby foods vs typical lunch items from the Standard American Diet such as packaged soup mixes He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin for infant humans by at least four fold in a single meal of processed foods Mother s milk was well below the effective dose Read Olney s review paper in Prog Brain Res 1988 and check his sources They are impecable There is no dispute Impeccable There most certainly is a dispute Between who

the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to These young men are supported financially by Iran most of the time They sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for Israeli patrols Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians This a tried and true method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace thus forcing the opposing state to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or in order to avoid the deaths of civilians abandon the search Certainly the people who use the population for cover are also to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm s way Are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover Israel should totally back down So the easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives If Israel insists that the so called Security Zone is necessary for the protection of Northern Israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers Your damn right Israel insists on some sort of demilitarized or buffer zone Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory of Arab states and watched as the states did nothing It is not exactly surprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to do it themselves If Israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from OUR land What So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states can start all over again While I also hope for this to happen it will only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are prepared to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their soil They have to Prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way Israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of tolerance towards anti Israel guerillas in residence I have written before on this very newsgroup that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled Good lord Brad What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stop anything They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allows them in It can ask them to leave at any time as Nasser did in 56 and 67 Somehow with that limitation on the troops powers I don t think that Israel is going to be any more comfortable Without a genuine commitment to peace from the Arab states and concrete not intellectual or political exercises in jargon guarantees by other parties the UN is worthless to Israel but perhaps useful as a ruse This is the only realistic solution it is time for Israel to realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed In fact it has caused much more Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel would have resulted in Perhaps you are aware that to most communities of people there is the feeling that it is better that many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently accept our fate If however you call on Israel to see the sense of suffering fewer casualties I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian Arab and Islamic groups If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the so called Security Zone before the conclusion of the peace talks Such a move would save Israeli lives advance peace efforts give Israel a great moral lift better Israel s public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important concessions Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah be disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider re taking the buffer zone and will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it From Israel s perspective concessions gets it NOTHING except the realization that it has given something up and now can only hope that the other side decides to do likewise Words can be taken back by merely doing so to take back tangible items land control of land requires the sort of action you say Israel should stay away from Israel put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon The entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above 1 Israel would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state involved 2 that state promptly ignored the entire matter secure in the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts committed by private groups 3 Israel would prepare for the next round of attacks What would Israel want to return to those days and don t be so idiotic as to suggest trust for the motivations of present day Arab states There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such circumstances Ah ok what is different about the present situation that tells us that the Arab states will not pursue their past antagonistic policies towards Israel Now don t talk about vague political factors but about those tangible just like that which Israel gave up factors that guarantee the responsibility of those states Your assessment of difference here is based on a whole lot of assumptions and most states don t feel confortable basing their existence on that sort of thing and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of Lebanon Basil It has not Without the support and active involvement of Syria Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be

they were not addressed to me specifically but I feel that I am a bit concerned by the thread since I am a Southern Lebanese from a village that is often on the receiving end of Israel s bombs In the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied Lebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder It is disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder This exercise is aimed solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth It seems to me Dorin that you are so remote and ignorant of the problem on the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation I will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of what the situation really is in South Lebanon In article Dorin Baru writes Is there any Israeli a civilian in your opinion Now I do not condone myself bombing villages any kind of villages But you claim these are villages with civilians and Iraelis claim they are camps filled with terrorists You claim that israelis shell the villages with the hope of finding a terrorist or so If they kill one fine if not too bad civilians die right I am not so sure I am I was back in my home village this last summer For your information we are PEOPLE not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists Most of the people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily business some work in the fields some own small shops others are older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee Is that so hard to imagine It is NOT a terrorist camp as you and the Israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc SOME young men usually

Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians Once they are back they announce that they bombed a terrorist hideout where an 8 year old girl just happened to be We are now accustomed to Israeli tactics and we figure that this is the Israeli way of telling us that if you re gonna hurt our soldiers you re gonna pay the price We accept this as a price we have to pay to free our land Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting the resistance that much militarily with these strikes but rather just keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young men to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are taking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers Israel s retalliation policy is cold hearted but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with the Lebanese Resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw this is the only real leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw The people of South Lebanon are occupied or shelled by Israel on a regular basis We do not want to be occupied If Israel insists that the so called Security Zone is necessary for the protection of Northern Israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers If Israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from OUR land We are not asking for the establishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect our villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel so the best policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the establishment of peace keeping troops along the border I have written before on this very newsgroup that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are

justifies murder I agree only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing CANNOT be qualified as murder no matter what you say I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make similar

ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion Energy special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY March 1989 Aneutronic energy fusion with little or negligible neutron flux requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times larger than can be delivered by current approaches If plasma pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds could be achieved in aneutronic fuels then high power densities and very compact realtively clean burning engines for space and other special applications would be at hand The PLASMAKtm innovation will make this possible its unique pressure efficient structure exceptional stability fluid mechanically compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power conversion advantages are described Peak burn densities of tens of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the multi gigawatt electric output size Engineering advantages indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost I strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously Bob Hirsch the primary proponent of the Tokamak has recently declared Koloc s PLASMAKtm precursor the spheromak to be one of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather than Tokamak

up this issue of PC Mag April 13 and check it out for yourself Windows The recent reviews have all shown that the P9000 cards are significantly faster doing Windows than the ATI card VGA The recent reviews have all shown that the P9000 cards they looked at are significantly slower doing VGA than the ATI card About 1 2 the speed as I recall The big question for me is the Orchid V9000 card Each of the P9000 cards tested so far has had the W5186 to do VGA Orchid is the only one I know about I don t know about AMI that uses the W5286 for VGA That is reportedly faster I would like to know whether the Orchid card can do VGA as fast as the ATI card If so it would appear to be a formidable competitor Advertised prices are about the same for the two cards Someone in this group posted a little

performer The Actix card is rated the best in this chip class non local bus It got glowing reports from the magazine was a best buy and I called them directly and they just updated their windows drivers last week They have a bulletin board to get the latest drivers Though somone posted that this bbs was at 2400 AT any rate the Actix graphics engine ultra outperforms all the other cards in the 928 class based on the winmark results If you are looking for the all around best dos windows performance check out the actix card Their 1 800 number is 927 5557 P S The article in pc magazine noted that if you are a regular dos user ie games then you should also check out the 801 chip from s3 It apparently scores just as well and in many cases slightly better in dos than the 928 chip ie stealth

measure them What mediated thair interaction with the real world a moralon Or a scalar valuino field Science the real world has its basis in values not the other way round as you would wish it If there is no such thing as objective value then science can not objectively be said to be more useful than a kick in the head Simple theories with accurate predictions could not objectively be said to be more useful than a set of tarot cards You like those conclusions I don t I think that you are changing the meaning of values here Perhaps it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word value n 1 A fair equivalent or return for something such as goods or service 2 Monetary or material worth 3 Worth as measured in usefulness or importance merit 4 A principle standard or quality considered inherently worthwhile or desirable 5 Precise meaning as of a word 6 An assigned or calculated numerical quantity 7 Mus The relative duratation of a tone or rest 8 The relative darkness or lightness of a color 9 The distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound In context of a moral system definition four seems to fit best In terms of scientific usage definitions six or eight might apply Note that these definitions do not mean the same thing In my mind to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach Science has its basis in observable fact Even the usages of the word value above do not denote observable fact but rather a standard of measurement I would conclude that science does not have its basis in values and so your statement above fails In fact if one concludes that a scientific set of measurements values are based on systems derived from observation then it must follow that in a scientific context there is no such thing as there is no such thing as objective values Back to the present This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow Just because the word values is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts If one is to argue for objective values in a moral sense then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective Considering the meaning of the word objective I doubt that this will ever happen So back to the original question And objective morality is If you can provide an objective foundation for morality then that will be a good beginning Frank O Dwyer I m not hatching

University Fort Collins CO 80523 Lines 123 I m quite astonished shocked and appalled at this serious frontal assault on emerging American freedoms The Clinton administration nor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever in regulating cryptography To do so is tantamount to regulating acceptable speech and is blatantly unconstitutional Perhaps we should rename this year 1984 in honor of such an illustrious proposal Let the Crappy Chip live in infamy and the adminstration receive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure I am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology to restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures The U S government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any serious threat to my liberties such as this and I call on everyone with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this proposal The administration does not seem to understand that they are merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the public and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is wholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals It seems to me that U S Diplomatic communications should be tappable by the U N whenever any countries produce a warrant to the U N In fact I think we should stop paying the NSA billions of dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason These actions violate the sovereignity of international law I hope Mr Clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here But if he isn t it s a modest and reasonable proposal so he should find merit with it nevertheless Cryptography is neutral technology If everybody has strong cryptography including policemen bureacrats businessmen housewives thugs and hoodlums we have a sustainable equilibrium Anything less is an unworkable anti egaltarian arrangement intrinsically antithetical to American freedoms and guaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent impracticality We don t need to compromise on issues of freedom For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans For too long our government has demonstrated itself to be increasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality and protecting Americans Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law It is not possible for the Federal Government to act quickly or develop consistent comprehensive policies PERIOD And even if by some grandiose miracle such a thing were possible it would only be an efficient way to deprive American citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights The administration has to be committed to leaving private industries alone esp on this issue The government has no legitimate role in regulating the content of communications Law enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their surveillance bludgeon they are soon and inevitably to be disarmed of it Q If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices No such laws can be constitutionally sound and this is equivalent to a veiled threat which I don t appreciate This kind of extortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism I will trade threats for threats and violation for violation The Administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done If the administration did say this it would find itself impeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential established entrenched and explicit constitutional privacy guarantees The administration would have no legal standing whatsoever such an action would be egregiously illegal and criminal and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast segments of the population nor is the U S saying that every American as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product The U S comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically committed to preserving their privacy in the face of an increasingly totalitarian government is saying just that Take your chips and give them to NSA employees as Christmas bonuses We can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please and we will make any chips we please and we will send any bit pattern over our data highways we please And if you try to stop us you will be gradually or abruptly dissolved into nothingness privacy vs law enforcement There is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or proposition This is an outright Dingaling Denning lie The two aims of privacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally incompatible and you have to work for the NSA to think otherwise Americans are about to discover ways through the use of technology to preserve their inalienable but

bill will have teeth not bare gums Clinton said In particular his administration will place strict controls on data formats and protocols and require the registration of so called cryptographic keys in the hope of denying drug dealers the ability to communicate in secret Clinton said the approach could be used for crackdowns on other forms of underground economic activity such as the deficit causing tax evaders who live in luxury at the expense of our grandchildren Clinton expressed optimism that the drug war can be won because even though not everyone voted for Bill Clinton last November everyone did vote for a candidate who shares my sense of urgency about fighting the drug menace The advocates of legalization the advocates of surrender may be very good at making noise Clinton said

following press release today 4 6 I ve typed it in verbatim for you folks to chew over Many of the topics recently discussed on sci space are covered in this Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance Dr John H Gibbons Director Office of Science and Technology Policy outlined to the members designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3 three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station A low option of 5 billion a mid range option of 7 billion and a high option of 9 billion will be considered by the committee Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development operations utilization Shuttle integration facilities research operations support transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds Over the next 5 years 4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President s new technology investment As a result station options above 7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget For example a space station option of 9 billion would require 2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee Generally the members designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners the Europeans Japanese and Canadians have decided after consultation to give full consideration to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process To that end the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as needed consulting basis so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems The U S and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilities Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal Gibbons reiterated that President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents However he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation NASA Administrator Daniel S Goldin said the Russian participation will be accomplished through the East West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland under the

INDEXES THROUGH MARCH FINAL NOTES ARTICLES 1 US COMMERCIAL SPACE SALES FLATTEN IN 1993 The US Department of Commerce projects US commercial space sales will remain flat in 1993 with current data showing only a 2 percent growth over 1992 As published in US Industrial Outlook 1993 which was released in January revenues from the 1993 US space business are currently projected to be about 4 890 M In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had shown double digits growth rates this year s projected results are driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry where sales are projected to drop from 12 satellites worth 1 300 M in 1992 to 7 satellites worth 670 M in 1993 The US Industrial Outlook also projects U S commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to 450 M future sales will be adversely affected by the downward revision in Department of Defense launch plans Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to increase to 1 900 M primarily driven by increased revenues from broadcast and cable TV networks Similarly remote sensing products and sales are projected to increase to 250 M in 1993 up 15 US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES 1989 1990 1991 1992 r 1993 e Commercial satellites 900 1 000 1 100 1 300 670

data for 1993 Commentary This is the first look at how the US commercial space industry is expected to do in 1993 In general not a bad report with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite manufacturing area There changes of only a few satellites worth 100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual projection If we look forward over several years this market sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very successful in regaining international market share in the satellite business Furthermore sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in the next revision of this data expected to be released about mid year Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales including such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals appears to be missing from the January data set DoC usually publishes a listing of Space Business Indicators in mid year and the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released then I expect the revised revenues should easily top 5 000 M if the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the numbers and the year should show about a 10 overall market growth Looking beyond this year s data future markets look quite promising The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top 3 000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct broadcasting are implemented as planned and that mobile satellite station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15 20 per year through the mid 1990 s My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic for near term market growth but I agree the trend should be for substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the next 5 10 years My pessimism is due to more conservative assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and satellite direct broadcasting services I don t believe all of the current players in the yet to be born LEO communications satellite market and in the yet to be proven direct broadcasting market will be financial successes nor that sales growth will be as explosive as currently projected It should also be noted this year s DoC data is the first release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research facilities The 60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for the Spacehab module planned for launch in April on the Space Shuttle but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module 2 DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS McDonnell Douglas Corporation which builds and markets the Delta launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts Motorola Inc announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to launch most of the satellites in the 66 satellite Iridium LEO communications constellation and in mid April McDonnell Douglas was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium satellites Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle launches These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be launched 5 at a time providing for at least 9 launches Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation such as a planned on orbit spares may also be launched on Delta Although details of the launch services contract were reported to be negotiation and not yet final The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC bidding a variant of their Delta II launcher This contract is only initially worth 7 5 million but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 launches encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002 These launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF s Global Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites plus other programs First option for to meet the USAF launch options is expected to be exercised this year after which the USAF is expected to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years Under this contract the USAF can also request launch on demand services from MDC for the 1996 2002 time period with a launch to occur within 40 days of the request Commentary If these two contracts are fulfilled they should provide an excellent business base for MDC s Delta launch program through the turn of the century Combined these two contracts have a potential for about 45 launches worth about 2 200 M to MDC and sustaining a core business base of 300 400 M year Other contracts for international and commercial payloads as well as for NASA Medium ELV class payloads will add to this business base keeping MDC as a viable commerical launch company However it should be noted there are risk elements in these contracts Motorola s Iridium LEO communications constellation has not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for operation in the U S nor has Motorola lined up all the financing and financial partners for the Iridium venture Without these approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches But hopefully these uncertainties will be settled this year Similarly the USAF MLV III program has been the target of several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III program in favor of the USAF NLS Spacelifter program At this time while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed future funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy reviews Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and Congress propose cancellation of all ELV upgrade programs including the MLV programs in favor of the proposed Spacelifter program Such opinions may have some weight in this year s budget deliberations particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to find in the shrinking US Defense budget 3 COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC GO AHEAD The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of Commerce s Office of Space Commerce A license was granted to WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland California to build and operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi spectral images of the Earth Commentary There has been little data released on this venture by WorldView and the DoC other than the announcement of the operating and construction license This was reported to be at the request of WorldView Most industry speculation identifies this new venture as a Star Wars spinoff using SDI type technology to provide digital Earth sensing data and heavily integrated into digital GIS databases for remote sensing GIS users Most probable customers for this service include exploration geologists agricultural planners and urban planners It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act The Act as passed last November provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices Prior to this act remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to all users at the same prices and private remote sensing ventures would have had to sell at the government set Landsat data prices There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote sensing ventures working their way through the system at different stages of development I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing data market for the next decade or so In contrast to these large government sponsored remote sensing systems smaller market ventures such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use innovative technology and I believe can find profitability on the margin I predict there may be some very interesting ventures appearing in the next year or so 4 INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD S SPACE BIZ STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General Dynamic s Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches In a recent analyst s report Morgan Stanley said We are more than ever convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical 95 plus success rate this will become a highly profitable cash generating unit Based upon discussions with GD s corporate management Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are cleared up the unit could see 70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and 100 M per year by 2000 This is based upon GD s projection of capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market Commentary Three failures in a row of their launch system has hurt General Dynamic s Space Systems Division Since GD has restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses many market pundits have been speculating GD s space business might be next to be sold The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD s Space Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker despite current problems if they can get their act together Sales are projected to be about 560 M in 1993 which will probably generate a loss of about 25 M If GD can capture their projected share of the space launch market and if they have managed to clean up the reliability of their Atlas launchers then they could generate healthy profits from those sales But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur program is back on track this division will continue to show substantial losses In response to the sell off rumors in my opinion this operation is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability To do such a takeover the current set corporate and divisional management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm In GD SSD s case to get the division back on track the management team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with the Atlas Centaur as well as in selling Atlas services This would indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch operations could find such talent in house and be able to convince customers to buy their launch services Optimally the firm would have substantial liquid rocket experience and experience in marketing space technology internationally as well Candidates for this might be TRW Rockwell Lockheed and Martin and possibly McDonnell Douglas and Boeing But most of those firms have cash flow problems MDC have had a substantial business contraction Boeing and MDC are involved with other launch firms Lockheed or have taken on substantial debt Martin And coming up with the 700 1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of change for any company 5 ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND Arianespace the operator of the Ariane launch system is projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990 s In early February Arianespace released their annual market survey which detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the next decade Over short run Arianespace expects to retain their dominant position and sustain a majority share of the launch market Of 54 international and commercial launches planned through 1995 Ariane holds contracts for 31 General Dynamics Atlas vehicle holds 14 contracts McDonnell Douglas Delta holds 7 and Great Wall s Long March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts Three quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can compete are projected to come from communications satellites with the remaining 25 split between weather Earth observation and scientific satellites Most of the future telecommunications demand growth is predicted to come from the Asia Pacific region Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will continue with these groups investing in heavier satellites with larger communications payloads carrying more transponders Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications satellites should increase by 20 over today s average level to about 3000 kg in GEO Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain strong over the next three years but in the second half of the decade Arianespace predicts demand will decrease Arianespace bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder demand and supply particularly as new data compression techniques appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing or near term transponders One of the significant possible changes in the market was identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles including Russian launch systems But Arianespace predicts that in the long term investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade off between launch service quality and price and that Russian and other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities and service quality and their market penetration will be minimal Commentary Ariane releases their market surveys annually and I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN STI Comparing the two surveys there aren t outstanding differences in the numbers The most notable change is the consideration of new data compression techniques reducing the demand for new physical transponders on orbit I note that in contrast to some predictions demand for space based communications transponders appears to be remain strong While fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the established point to point telecommunications markets growing demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point to multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space transponder demand Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability service but only from established point A to established point B To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable between the points and while there are improved network solutions installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost millions or billions of dollars For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground network structure satellites still offer the most cost effective solution And if new services are required into a new region it is cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite network This allows rapid growth of new satellite services and has kept demand high The replacement market for fiberoptics is growing as well since as demand grows between the points serviced it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to handle the increase in traffic Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still growing rapidly satellite market projections remain rosy But satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes Current generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of on orbit service or more in contrast to 10 years of service from last generation s satellites This has cut back some of the launch demand as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite launches over longer intervals And as last note Arianespace didn t flag it this year but it looks like the space transportation market will be rather over supplied by existing launch systems in the near term The annual commercial launch demand is for about 15 20 medium sized satellites per year From the supply side Ariane is capable of launching up to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year Delta is capable of about 9 12 per year Atlas is capable of 6 12 Long March 4 8 Japan s H Vehicle 2 4 Russia s Proton capable of 8 and other systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10 20 medium launches per year That s a lot of capability for a small market We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial launches 6 NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety rules A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation of range safety rules In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown one of two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed Such a failure typically scrubs a launch and a NASA range safety officer at Wallops Island VA issued a mission abort order about a minute before the scheduled Pegasus launch Somehow this command was overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the communications channels and the Pegasus was launched despite the valid abort call Fortunately the Pegasus functioned as expected and the abort command receiver was not needed But this incident did spark an investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed to launch constraint rules and was not obeyed Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety Board NTSB with support from NASA OSC and the Air Force This investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an incident involving a space launch According to the NTSB their investigation will take about 6 months and is primarily looking at lines of authority communications links and safety procedures used in the launch Commentary This is the first time that the NTSB has led an investigation into a space launch Their leadership was requested by the Department of Commerce s Office of Commercial Space Transportation who had licensed the commercial launch At the time of writing this column some of the initial investigations have been concluded and some of the results are starting to leak out into the trade press Apparently 3 or four different communications channels were in use during the test After the abort destruct receiver stopped responding the NASA test director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch According to the mission rules this should have stopped the launch Somehow the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed and the NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B 52 carrying the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch Differing explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed with the best set being that clear lines of communications and clear definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team and understanding of the mission rules were not established before the launch As we see more and more commercial launches more of these procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem as they do with commercial aircraft problems I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with procedures and communications and will be cleared up with issuance of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how specific lines of authority should be delineated 7 ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new small space launch system based upon converted ICBM components Two versions of the launcher are being marketed the Aerokosmos winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus and the Severkosmos launched from a mobile ground transporter The Aerokosmos is projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to an 800 km circular orbit and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km Also proposed to be used with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called Sineva Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex military establishment focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the Buran shuttle system They are located near the NPO Energia facility in Kaliningrad outside of Moscow Commentary There s very little released information on this new venture My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in house knowledge of ex Soviet launch systems It adds to the list of numerous commercial space startups announced from the ex Soviet Union This one s a little different in that they are offering variants of ex Soviet ICBMs but I can t identify any key customers being targeted or substantial financial backing 8 GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING In late January Georgia Tech Research Institute released the results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial rocket launching site in Camden County Georgia at the old Kingsland Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast The preliminary study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch site stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected low investment returns plus environmental and other geographic considerations However the report did say the site might be ideal for other aerospace uses and recommended other potential uses Commentary This should put the nails in the coffin of the Kingsland Commercial Launch Site While other sites are still proceeding with commercial launch site development plans Kingsland found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant and if substantial infrastructure had to be put in then the expected returns were too low to justify the cost of development This might point out some key discriminators in judging the feasibility of a commercial launch site These include Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage sufficient to recover setup costs Is there a market advantage of using the site Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the investment Other commercial launch site ventures including those at Woomera Poker Flat Cape York White Sands Alabama Off Shore Platform Hawaii and Vandenberg have to also be judged against these criteria In my opinion some of these ventures are flying on hope and speculation and not on sound financial grounds 9 SPAIN S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING In one of his last official acts former President Bush authorized space technology transfer for several joint space ventures between US and other firms One of these was a proposed use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster With that regulatory impediment removed the 3 stage Capricornia launch vehicle will start development later this year planning for a first launch in the 1995 96 time period The Capricornia is described as a small 3 stage all solid booster designed to put 250 500 Kg into LEO Several launch sites are being examined for the system including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands Originated by INTA in Spain the project reports it has 30 M in development funding and will use technology from Argentina s Condor launch vehicle as well as from the US Commentary Several firms have identified a market opportunity in providing a small launcher for the European market Small payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either Ariane piggyback launches or the US Italian Scout launcher However Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited and the Scout program is being phased out accompanied by some disarray in the Italian government and space industry regarding any follow on system This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch system Surprisingly enough ESA has not supported development of such a system within the current space funding structure Studies have been performed by British Aerospace Aerospatiale Deutsche Aerospace and Italian organizations but with the exception of the Swedish PacAstro system reported below I have not been able to find any other European development work with even a rumor of funding for hardware Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the Argentinian Condor launcher There have been some interesting rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space launcher IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled the country in the 1970 s and early 1980 s What is known is in Feb 1992 the Argentinian Air Force formally transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new civilian Argentinian national space agency Comison Nacional de Atividades Espaciales CNAE The Condor 2 program was described as originating in 1983 expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German firms The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq in the mid 1980 s Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and tested but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package lagged that of the propulsion system It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first scientific satellite in late 1994 The US 9 M 181 Kg SAC B satellite will study the Earth s upper atmosphere and includes cooperative experiments from Italy and the US No launch vehicle has yet been selected but OSC s Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this contract 10 PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP PacAstro a small launch firm in Herndon Virginia announced in late February it had received a 6 M launch reservation contract from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro s PA 2 launch vehicle This will be performed as part of the Polar Satellite Service PSS a joint Norwegian Space Center Swedish Space Corp program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and offering small satellite launches into the polar regions According to PacAstro PSS is also performing an 8 M upgrade of the Andoya launch facilities including a new integration facility and a fully enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like the PacAstro PA 2 PacAstro has been chosen as the main alternative rocket supplier for the small satellite launch service to be offered by PSS from Andoya The date of the launch of the Swedish satellite was not specified Commentary PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and funding for their launch vehicle for some time now The PA 2 is a small two stage rocket fueled by RP 1 and Liquid Oxygen From PacAstro s literature the engines designed for the PA series rockets are built of off the shelf components based upon the Lunar MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW and are capable of putting a 225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its first three PA 2 vehicles with a first launch planned for 1995 and 2 orbital launches planned for 1996 My records show PacAstro hired TRW to provide marketing support and systems design with primary engineering to be done by AeroAstro a small satellite builder closely associated with PacAstro headquartered in the same building The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering launch operations vehicle subsystems and marketing support Sumitomo Corp of Tokyo is a first round investor and sits on the board of directors PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least 550 K Some sources place this of high as 1 M but has been searching for about a year for the additional 20 30 M needed to design build and launch their first set of vehicles The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help bring some investors on board but by my estimate they will need much more than the single 6 M sale to put their venture into real hardware 11 CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED In early March it was reported a joint satellite communications venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works As reported in the Taipei press China Development Corp CDC headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist Party is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China Great Wall Industry Corp with the objective of launching a regional communications satellite CDC would cover about 10 of the satellite system cost US 10 M in exchange for rights to 10 of the satellite s communications channels Commentary This announcement came close on the heels of the release of Taiwanese plans for space development released in mid January In those plans the National Space Program Office of Taiwan will launch 3 satellites starting with ROCSAT 1 a 400 Kg scientific spacecraft planned for launch in 1997 Two additional satellites are planned both communications satellites TRW has been helping Taiwan plan this program budgeted at T 13 6 B US 530 M through 2006 I haven t been able to establish any relationship between this venture and those of the NSPOT but there might be a connection While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures the current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two separate sastellite ventures The reported name for the Tiawanese Chinese system is Asiasat 2 but I don t thinks this has any relationship with the existing Hong Kong based Asiasat program involving Chinese Hong Kong and other Asian investors other than using it as an organizational model There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing venture it could provide excellent first hand experience to Taiwan for a very low cost which then can be used in later satellite ventures But there are internal political issues between Taiwanese and Chinese ventures but putting any joint venture through a Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to proceed In any case the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with substantially growth projected in space services and revenues This is just another indicator to add to the list 12 SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES South Korea s Trade Industry and Resources Ministry recently announced plans to invest US 22 B in research and development and another US 17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for advanced aerospace technologies Space technologies have been specifically targeted as part of this program beginning with manufacture and launch of an advanced multi purpose satellite by 1997 The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea s aerospace technology to the level of the world s top 10 countries by 2000 Commentary South Korea has been quietly working to develop its national aerospace industry specifically including space activities I m noting this as a flag that potential new players are coming into the commercial space market As part of their national effort 2 national telecommunications satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 on Delta Designated Koreasat 1 and 2 the platforms will provide television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on Ariane in Aug 1992 called Uribyol 1 Our Star and costing about US 8 8 M Uribyol 2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of this year again on Ariane and will be entirely made in Korea Uribyol 3 projected for a 1995 launch will be an environment monitoring micro satellite This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth observation satellites The KEOS Korean Earth Observation System project which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean government would use two or three 300 kg spacecraft equipped with optical and microwave sensors South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel military effort to establish the capabilities for building and launching small military satellites by 2001 Supposedly a government panel had been established to oversee such an effort funded at US 500 M between 1993 and 2001 in anticipation of an expected pullout of U S intelligence gathering systems from the Korean peninsula In conjunction with all of these reported efforts South Korean is also pursuing production work either as off sets to existing aerospace technology contracts for example McDonnell Douglas is offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as part of the Koreasat launch contracts or for production of consumer space items among other products South Korea exports satellite receiver television setups to Japan and Samsung has announced teaming for production of OSC s Orbcomm user terminals This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector for commercial space

THROUGH MARCH As announced in the last CSN STI each issue will give the results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and investments The table below summarizes results to the end of March The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the market as a whole as represented by the S P 500 index Since 90 of the values included in the index are US firms this represents a general increase in the market value of space related firms The increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 which is a very promising sign although future months may reverse this trend The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite well but the Pure Play portfolio consisting of stocks of firms which are pure plays in space technologies has also surpassed its results in all of 1993 We ll keep an eye on these INDEX RESULTS THROUGH MARCH Beginning Beginning 1 Jan 93 to 1992 1993 31 Mar 1993 S P 500 416 436 4 7 452 3 7 Space Tech Index 267 304 13 6 373 22 7 Comm l Space

CONTROVERSIAL QUESTIONS These issues periodically come up with much argument and few facts being offered The summaries below attempt to represent the position on which much of the net community has

Despite a widespread belief to the contrary the Saturn V blueprints have not been lost They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on microfilm The problem in re creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings it is finding vendors who can supply mid 1960 s vintage hardware like guidance system components and the fact that the launch pads and VAB have been converted to Space Shuttle use so you have no place to launch from By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re modify the launch pads you may as well have started from scratch with a clean sheet design WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being scooped by people uninvolved in the mission However NASA frequently releases examples in non digital form e g photos to the public early in a mission RISKS OF NUCLEAR RTG POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium thermal sources being dangerous Numerous studies claim that even in worst case scenarios shuttle explosion during launch or accidental reentry at interplanetary velocities the risks are extremely small Two interesting data points are 1 The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2 RTGs which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather satellite failed to reach orbit The fuel was recovered after 5 months with no release of plutonium 2 In April 1970 the Apollo 13 lunar module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source which was jettisoned fell intact into the 20 000 feet deep Tonga Trench in the Pacific Ocean The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10 half lives of the Pu 238 fuel or about 870 years DOE 1980 To make your own informed judgement some references you may wish to pursue are A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel Salisbury in Radiation Risk and Planetary

LAYER From time to time claims are made that chemicals released from the Space Shuttle s Solid Rocket Boosters SRBs are responsible for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer Studies indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact both in absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources The remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted study Charles Jackman The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups and was organized by Dr Michael Prather NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia NASA GISS Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze Atmospheric and Environmental Research Inc The effort was to look at the effects of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine Industrial sources 300 000 000 kilograms year Natural sources 75 000 000 kilograms year Shuttle sources 725 000 kilograms year The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are launched yearly Thus the launches would add less than 0 25 to the total stratospheric chlorine sources The effect on ozone is minimal global yearly average total ozone would be decreased by 0 0065 This is much less than total ozone variability associated with volcanic activity and solar flares The influence of human made chlorine products on ozone is computed by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1 decrease in globally averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990 The influence of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible The launch schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons do at the present time Theoretical

School of Aerospace Medicine Brooks AFB Texas HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion This is a well documented fact see the Rogers Commission report for example What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank came apart The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the astronauts never mind destroy their bodies according to the Kerwin team s medical forensic report The astronauts were killed when the more or less intact cabin hit the water at circa 200MPH and their bodies then spent several weeks underwater Their remains were recovered and after the Kerwin team examined them they were sent off to be buried USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT You can t use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit because it can t get there It is big and heavy and does not carry enough fuel even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks Furthermore it is not particularly sensible to do so because much of that weight is things like wings which are totally useless except in the immediate vicinity of the Earth The shuttle orbiter is highly specialized for travel between Earth s surface and low orbit Taking it higher is enormously costly and wasteful A much better approach would be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high orbit spacecraft Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer THE FACE ON MARS There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid face It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery 35A72 much more facelike in appearance and the one more often published with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon and 70A13 with the Sun 27 degrees from the west Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is artificial intended to resemble a human and erected by an extraterrestrial civilization Most other analysts concede that the resemblance is most likely accidental Other Viking images show a smiley faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere on Mars There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society sorry don t know the address to study the Face The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high resolution camera and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this question in a few years In the meantime speculation about

misc consumers rpw last change 8 February 1993 CT now permits radar detector usage new tire traction q a rpw Commonly Asked Questions Radar Questions Q Where are radar detectors illegal A In the US currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit all usage of radar detectors New York prohibits their use in large trucks In Canada they are illegal in Manitoba Ontario Quebec Newfoundland and PEI Prince Edward Island They are apparently are illegal through most if not all of Europe Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other jurisdictions chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal Q Where are Radar Detector Detectors used Do they really work A Usage is spreading rapidly initially they were used only in Canada but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia It is unsafe to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D C They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently available super Het radar detectors some brands of detector radiate more strongly than others and are thus more likely to be spotted New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected by the current generation of detector detectors Note that a detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned on Q What is VASCAR Is it some kind of Radar A VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time speed distance computer It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target vehicle passes landmarks No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR system Q What is Ka band radar Where is it used Should a radar detector be able to handle it A Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US in so called photo radar installations In these installations a low powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the direction of traffic and a picture is taken of vehicles which the radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle Because of the low power and the 45 degree angle many people believe that a radar detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such capability anyway The number of locales where photo radar is in use is limited and some question the legality of such units Best advice learn what photo radar units look like and keep track of where they are used or else don t speed Q Do radar jammers work Are they legal A Quick answer No and Not in the USA Detailed answer Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the military Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the Federal Communications Commission of the USA Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions Q What are understeer and oversteer A Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a car while cornering near the limit limit of adhesion that is Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to be descriptive of the situations they encounter Simply put they tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner steer less or understeer or it wants to turn more in a corner oversteer Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that untrained drivers inadvertantly traveling too fast won t get into trouble Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle in a corner Oversteer is designed into some more performance oriented cars it may be induced by lifting on the throttle Trailing throttle oversteer or TTO In extreme cases lifting on the throttle may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or spinning Some technical details in a corner at speed the tires on the car will develop what are called slip angles the slip angle is the angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to travel In understeer the front wheels have a greater slip angle than the rear wheels In oversteer the rear wheels have a greater slip angle than the front wheels Q What is a rev matched downshift A When downshifting the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear than it was in the higher gear However during a downshift normally you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle so the revs drop rather than increase In rev matched downshift you blip the throttle before re engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to the new speed This results in a much smoother and faster downshift Q What does heel and toe mean A Heel and toe is a technique used to do a rev matched downshift while braking This is normally challenging because you need the right foot for both the brake and throttle It is called heel and toe because you use one end of the foot on the brake and the other on the throttle to match revs for the downshift In many modern cars this is a misnomer often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side on the throttle Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch and just use the left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle accomplishing the same thing Q What is double clutch downshifting A While your right foot is doing the above your left foot can do one of three things nothing declutch once or declutch twice The reason for declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the transmission to the speed of the engine This is usually coupled with rev matching so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch engaged the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission speed up The procedure is as follows 0 declutch 1 move gearshift lever to neutral 2 engage clutch 3 match revs 4 declutch 5 move gearshift lever to next lower gear 6 engage clutch This sounds like a lot of work but with practice it becomes natural The problem that double clutching solves is normally the function of the synchronizers within the gearbox In transmissions without synchros or with very worn synchros double clutching makes it much easier to shift Basically if you double clutch well you are not using the synchros at all This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good condition Q What do the numbers for acceleration from 0 60 1 4 mile skidpad and slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean May they be compared A In short 1 not as much as the magazines want you to believe and 2 almost never In more detail the acceleration numbers 0 60mph and 1 4 mile times in the US may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the same source Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine that comparing a Road Track number to a Car Driver number is quite pointless Keep in mind too that the same variation applies from driver to driver on the street the driver is a major often the major part of the equation Skidpads vary and even if they didn t skidpad figures are really only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires they change radically when tire compounds change DO NOT make any assumptions about the comparative handling of say two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value however Skidpads are an excellent educational tool at driving schools They are simply of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires Slalom times are slightly more useful they test some small parts of the automobile s transient response However they are also heavily influenced by the stock rubber on the car and they do not test many corners of the car s envelope They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making a buying decision For example they don t tell you what the rear end of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off camber When a car has an adjustable suspension these tests are usually done in the sport setting which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving The list of caveats could go on for page after page Q My buddy claims that wide tires don t make any difference according to his freshman physics textbook and that you can t ever accelerate or corner at more than 1 0G Does he know what he s talking about A 1 in short he hasn t got a clue 2 in more detail the equations for friction used in freshman physics textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth dry and non deformable none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating temperature Pavement is _never_ smooth it is always irregular to a greater or lesser extent Tires which are not really dry and solid as rubber is a substance which in its natural form is liquid and which has only been coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic deform to match the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over In a tire at operating temperature grip is actually generated by shear stresses inside the deformed rubber and not by anything even remotely resembling friction in the freshman physics sense of the term The colder a tire is relative to its operating temperature the closer its behaviour will be to the traditional concept of friction if much hotter than the its proper operating temperature the more likely the possibility of some part of the tire actually reverting to liquid which is mostly like to happen deep in the tread causing characteristic blisters and chunking This latter though is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal street driving so unless you re a competition driver or do a lot of high speed track driving don t worry about it Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all thus dragsters accelerate at more than 1 0G and race cars corner and brake at more than 1 0G Because simple friction does not apply it is actually possible for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of grip An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques such as Finite Element Analysis due to the complexity of the mechanism Misc Questions Q What does name or acronym stand for A Here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked about be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names as misinformation abounds on the net In particular NEVER ask in rec humor if you want a useful result Saab Svenska Aeroplan A B or The Swedish Airplane Corporation Alfa Societa Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili or The Lombardy Automobile Manufacturing Company Fiat Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino or The Italian Automobile Manufacturers of Turin BMW Bayerische Motoren Werke or Bavarian Motor Works MG Morris Garage Q Does VW own Porsche A No Porsche is a publicly held company controlled by the Porsche and Piech families Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW Audi which causes some confusion Since currently Porsche is in some financial difficulty there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may be interested in purchasing the company in the near future but this is only speculation at this time richard welty 518 393

trouble aiming for the bowl when he takes a dump Don t as me how I just have seen the results Boy I really wish we we cut the drug war and have more people screwed up in the head I m sorry about your friend Really But this anecdote does nothing to justify the war on drugs If anything it demonstrates that the war is a miserable failure What it demonstrates is that people will take drugs if they want to legal or not Perhaps if your friend were taking legal regulated drugs under a doctors supervision he might not be in the position he s in now I do agree with you in a way The war on drugs has failed but in my opinion that doesn t mean we have to give up Only change the tactics For instance here are how some penalties should be changed Dealing Coke Death Dealing Heroin Death Dealing Pot

interesting story on 60 minutes about how the British actually prescribe and addict his recommended dosage and try to ween him off from it or cut the amount down to levels where it is acceptable Sounds good so far from what I heard with a decrease in cost lower addiction rates by wiping out the dealer s markets etc But that was the only thing I have heard about it However legalizing it and

for selling drugs to kids now there s some bit Yeah that s it send a kid from the inner city who has no other viable means to make money and turns to selling drugs to an over crowded federal prison where he learns to do Real Crime Of course this kid would be much better off selling crack to his neighborhood and helping in its demise Without drug money being pumped into these blights from the affluent outside there would be no crime who would they steal from each other Drugs bring money into the community just like any other business would except that since drugs are illegal the economy is an underground one And if those drugs were legal the neighborhood could legally go to hell A self sustaining underground economy can only proliferate by a constant willful infusion of money from the outside If you take away drug laws you put an end to the underground economy and therefore to large scale crime And if we made murder legal we would put an end to murder as a crime Kids in the inner cities are faced with a very tough life growing up there or selling drugs and having everything at their fingertips instantly Many kids choose selling drugs They sell products to people who want to buy them They make money off of rich white kids from the suburbs Then they go to prison Then they become hardened criminals and learn that you re much better off stealing car stereos in the suburbs because all the police forces are spending all their money in the inner city saving people from themselves What You can bring up all the examples you want about crack babies and whathaveyou The

organizations like the DEA attempt to deceive the public Usage of one particular drug may have gone down but at the same time usage of other drugs may have gone up a k a substitution Also drug usage among one particular age group may have gone down but drug usage among another age group may have gone up Therefore if one takes a look at the big picture taking into consideration all the statistics then it s obvious that the so called war on drugs is being lost Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs go but if one factors in alcohol abuse smoking and use of inhalants then the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed in its true perspective For those of you who don t consider alcohol to be a drug then try drinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me that it s not a drug Agencies like the DEA only go after illegal drugs This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless attempt at preventing substance abuse people will merely switch to another drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular The solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to legalize some not all drugs whose toxicity has been shown to be within reasonable limits you won t drop dead after using it a few times and then couple this with a massive drug education program The reason why I think legalization is part of the solution is because people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the government s efforts to the contrary the money spent on drug interdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere e g drug education Additionally legalization would reduce crime because the profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often goes along with other kinds of crime Not to mention the fact that addicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their money and posessions in order to support their expensive habit legalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall substantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts IMHO the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been done to smokers make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to employ heavy handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating them As you already know people in the U S smoke a lot less than they used to This reduction in the number of smokers has been brought about by public awareness campaigns laws restricting where people can light up warning labels on cigarette packages taxation on tobacco in order to reduce consumption and so on I propose that similar methods be used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried out They are as follows Drugs being sold must come with clear concise information which states the possible health hazzards involved with using this product and recommendations on how the drug should be used Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs through illegal channels Part of the revenue collected from drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law enforcement Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors people under the age of 18 Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning information should also be a felony Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible This agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad drugs something that is a fairly serious problem now I m sure that many of the things I ve discussed in this article have been hashed out before in this newsgroup Nevertheless I thought it was a good idea to give my two cents actually a buck

LLNL is involved in lightweight sensor design per Clementine and related programs I m sure folks around here would like to see a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure but after all the U S did the Echo satellites long ago and an advertising structure would not be much closer to an inflatable space station than Echo was or a parade balloon for that matter What do you think of this

space If this is true I think it s a great idea Learning how to build structures in space in an essential step towards space development Which unfortunately this is not likely to contribute much to If

Unfortunately I don t have direct quotes handy 1 Atheists believe that when they die they die forever True to a point If you were to ask a Buddhist atheist 2 A god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death is unfair I don t see what the problem is To Christians Hell is by definition eternal death exactly what atheists are expecting when they die There s no reason Hell has to be especially awful to most people eternal death is bad enough Actually yes and no Hell is eternal death Actually the way I ve had it related to me it s more of an eternal damnation where sinners will feel the licking flames of Hell If I supposedly can feel these flames I would assume I m still alive but suffering and away from God Literal interpreters of the Bible will have a problem with this view since the Bible talks about the fires of Hell and such Personally I don t think that people in Hell will be thrust into flame any more than I expect to Jesus with a double edged sword issuing from his mouth I treat both these state ments as metaphorical I believe Jehovah s Witnesses have a similar view where the body sleeps for ever I don t have a problem with being condemned to Hell either The way I see it if God wants to punish me for being honest in my skepticism that is for saying he doesn t exist He certainly wouldn t be changing His nature Besides I would rather spend

If there was a heaven I would ME But since there isn t a Heaven you re not going there are you HIM No The point is that Heaven is based on faith if you don t believe in heaven there s no way you re going to be in it Hmmm people in the americas before the time of Christ children who die young etc Of course the next step is I don t believe in Hell either so why will I be there It seems to me that Hell is eternal death and seperation from God But of course the popular conception of hell correct or incorrect is something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness at the very least Most atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever and never see God so they do in fact believe that they re going to Hell I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond bodily death but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe they re going to hell They believe they re going to _die_ Understand that you ve turned Hell into a verb Using the same logic it also follows that all animals are going to Hell Are you sure this is what you want to say presumably animals don t have the opportunity to get to heaven but this still doesn t change the fact that they re going to Hell die a final death I don t claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_ sort but if Hell is as you described final death and not eternal perpetuation of consciousness it will be true that there will never be a moment when I am aware of my non existence assuming I go to Hell and not to Heaven In other words I ll never know I m dead Hmmm Hell doesn t have to be worse than earth to be Hell because it s eternal Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill and has died At least she s not suffering any more She s in Heaven now Consider the following statement At least she s not suffering any more She s in Hell now The above statement sounds odd but according to your definition of Hell it would be a true statement The person in Hell would not be suffering Granted they wouldn t be anything wouldn t be having any conscious experience whatsoever You say Hell death is eternal However this loses its meaning to a dead person And to me it seems that the threat of some sort of eternal punishment only makes sense has force if one expects to be conscious throughout this eternity Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the product of propaganda Friend do you want the FREE gift of e ternal life It s my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife Can anyone back me up on this combined with the survival instinct all animals share The difference is we have consciousness and once we get the idea of eternal life drilled into our brains we then desire a sort of super survival and it s a lot worse than Heaven That s the only comparison that matters That would depend on what Heaven is like If God is a King and an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King I might opt for Hell I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to convert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_ by Corliss Lamont The missionary started to speak about Heaven

called hell A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to experience it Whatever you or I as Christians do we should do whatever we can to win people to the Lord if for no other reason to keep them from going to outer darkness Jesus in Mt 25 tells us that He didn t prepare hell for people He prepared it for the Devil and his angels No where in the Bible do I read anywhere that God predestined anybody to go to hell D L Moody use to say that the elect are the whosoever will and the nonelect are the whosoever wont s Whether or not that s theologically sound I couldn t defend but its practical Jesus said to the people of Israel Ye would not Now some of you may not be students of the Bible heck some of you may not be Christians Have you ever said to somebody I don t believe in hell I believe in the religion of Jesus But did you know that Jesus talked more about hell than He did about heaven Oh I believe in the religion of the sermon on the mount You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the mount You ll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire Several times he talks about hell and about judgment In fact over and over in the synoptics Matthew Mark and Luke Jesus talks about hell Not Isaiah Not Moses Not John the Baptist though he did but Jesus the Son of God The great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn t want to see them go there Now if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain It was our Lord Jesus not some angry Baptist preacher that said where the worm never dies and where the fire never goes out Jesus said that It was Jesus who called hell a furnace of fire It was Jesus that used the word condemnation And this is the condemnation that men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil Jesus said that How can we get it across to you that a loving dying Jesus preached about hell Not only that but He went through hell That s what Calgary was all about When my Lord was on the cross darkness fell He called hell outer darkness Do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over here the drunks are getting drunk over there and the prostitutes are prostituting their bodies over there That s not what hell is Hell s not a party There s no fellowship there He called it outer darkness Outer away from God Darkness God is light No when He was on the cross He was made sin for you and for me God treated Jesus the way sinners have to be treated That s is a sobering thought As my son would say an awesome thought My God My God why hast Thou forsaken me Hell is isolation There s no fellowship in hell There s no friendship in hell There s no loving embrace in hell There s no hand shake in hell There s no word of encouragement in hell I thirst It goes much deeper than physical thirst Hell is eternal craving with no satisfaction The man whose life was lived for drugs will crave it eternally The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman s body will crave it eternally and not be satisfied One theologian has put it this way and I think it deserves merit What is hell Hell is just the kind of environment that matches the internal condition of the lost In a recent post I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life ministries I ve remembered his name Jack Wertzen and found that the illustration that I gave wasn t his His illustration was that he was talking to his barber and his barber s wife and daughter had just recently been saved and he was commenting about it to Jack They sing these songs and read Bible verses and their praising this and that I can t stand it Jack do you think God would send me to hell Jack answered by saying Yes I think he would Of course the barber said What do you mean by that Well if you can t stand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to God now what would you do in heaven where they ll do it for eternity You d be miserable Because God loves you He d put you where it would match what you really are It makes a man think The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal existence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act Don t ask me how I don t know But He is God and He is the infinite eternal and when He died He died an infinite eternal death It is by that eternal act that He purchased eternal life for the whosoever wills He suffered eternal judgment A lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying Everybody is going to be saved eventually universalism My Bible says no He ll separate them The sheep from the goats After you die there s a probationary period in which God prepares you for heaven No my Bible says that It is appointed unto men once to die and then comes judgment Some of the cultist believe in annihilation After you die sssswish Just like a mosquito you re squished out No in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as there is in heaven I don t enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don t enjoy listening to them but we have to preach the entire Word of God There is a place called hell If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any hope that people aren t going there I d give it to you but I haven t found it That fact that there is a place called hell the fact that our God is a God of holiness and must judge sin the fact that He has made us the kind of creatures we are and therefore we re responsible the fact that He has placed us in a uni verse that has purpose and design behind it the fact that sin is such an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us from hell leads us to two applications 1 As I ve already mentioned If you are a Christian you must worn others Its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridge is out Knowing therefore the terror of Lord we persuade men 2 If you haven t accepted Jesus are your Savior you re taking an awful chance As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses who no longer frequent my door if you are right and I am wrong then I will have lived a good life and will die and cease to exist but if I am right and you are wrong then you will die and suffer eternal damnation I don t mean to make fun at this point but its like Dirty Harry said You ve got to ask yourself Do I feel lucky Well do you A man s got to know his limitations Don t be one of the whosoever wont s Because while I was yet a sinner He died for me There s no greater love than this that a man lay down his life for another Rex']"

Certainty and Arrogance Organization University of Colorado Boulder Lines 66 In article Dr Nancy s Sweetie writes Dean Velasco quoted a letter from James M Stowell president of Moody Bible Institute We affirm the absolutes of Scripture not because we are arrogant moralists but because we believe in God who is truth who has revealed His truth in His Word and therefore we hold as precious the strategic importance of those absolutes There has been a lot of discussion but so far nobody seems to have hit on exactly what the criticism of arrogance is aimed at lots of stuff deleted This is where the arrogance of Christians arises many people believe that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the doctrines of Christianity they are implicitly claiming that they are infallible and that there is no possibility of mistake Claiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake and that your thinking has led you to a flawless conclusion is pretty arrogant I agree with what Darren has to say here but would like to add a personal observation What I see as arrogance and the problem I have with it is not a sense of personal certainty but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions Clearly this is not just Christian vs Non Christian there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within Christianity I do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because like aesthetics it is not demonstable by objective means Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal sovereignty What bothers me is when others suggest that in these matters of faith their specific beliefs are not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding on others It follows from this that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth and thus anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path This is the arrogance I see a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others It is universalizing those matters of personal faith coupled by a proud notion that one s relationship with God is superior to other s that leads to arrogance In my honest and nonuniversal opinion Darren F Provine At the core of all well founded belief lies belief that is unfounded Ludwig

like to see more clarification about what you mean when you reject the idea of saying their specific beliefs are not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding on others If something is true it is true for everyone assuming that the belief is something about God history etc Of course something of the form I believe that it s best for me not to xxx could be true for some people and not others I have suggested in the past that God may be less concerned about doctrinal agreement than many people are But that doesn t mean I doubt that there is a difference between true and false nor that I think there is no benefit in finding out what is true clh', 'From Carol Alvin Subject Re The arrogance of Christians Lines 88 Virgilio Dean B Velasco Jr writes In article Carol Alvin writes Virgilio Dean B Velasco Jr writes Carol Alvin writes Are all truths also absolutes Is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes The answer to both questions is yes an absolute is something that is constant across time culture situations etc True in every instance possible Do you agree with this definition Yes I do agree with your definition example of women covering their heads and not speaking Hold it I said that all of scripture is true However discerning exactly what Jesus Paul and company were trying to say is not always so easy I don t believe that Paul was trying to say that all women should behave that way Rather he was trying to say that under the circumstances at the time the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and cover their heads This has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward others Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived from absolutes For instance it is absolutely right for Christians to strive for peace However this does not rule out trying to maintain world peace by resorting to violence on occasion Yes my opinion I agree that there is truth in scripture There are principles to be learned from it Claiming that that truth is absolute though seems to imply a literal reading of the Bible If it were absolute truth constant across time culture etc then no interpretation would be necessary It may be that the lessons gleaned from various passages are different from person to person To me that doesn t mean that one person is right and the other is wrong I believe that God transcends our simple minds and that scripture may very well have been crafted with exactly this intent God knows me and knows that my needs are different from yours or anyone else s By claiming that scripture is absolute then at least one person in every disputed interpretation must be wrong I just don t believe that God is that rigid Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth And there are plenty of other examples Can you reconcile this Sure The Bible preaches absolute truths However exactly what those truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion As I said the Bible does preach absolute truths Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal clear at least to evangelicals This is where the arrogance comes in to play Since these principles are crystal clear to evangelicals maybe the rest of us should just take their word for it Maybe it isn t at all crystal clear to me that their fundamental principles are either fundamental or principles I think we ve established that figuring out Biblical truth is a matter of human interpretation and therefore error prone Yet you can still claim that some of them may be crystal clear Maybe to a certain segment of Christianity but to all It s very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based on your own interpretation is absolute God revealed his Truths to the world through His Word It is utterly unavoidable however that some people whill come up with alternate interpretations Practically anything can be misinterpreted especially when it comes to matters of right and wrong Care to deny that Not at all I think it supports my position much more effectively than yours So I think that your position is The Bible is absolute truth but as we are prone to error in our interpretation we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out what that truth is Did I get that right What s the point of spending all this time claiming and defending absolute truth when we can never know what those truths are and we can never or at least shouldn t act upon them What practical difference can this make Carol Alvin', 'From Virgilio Dean B Velasco Jr Subject Re The arrogance of Christians

because truth may be absolute but it may not be obvious Like so many things the truth is always subject to misinterpretation I strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here which is why I deign from commenting much further Sure The Bible preaches absolute truths However exactly what those truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion As I said the Bible does preach absolute truths

of us should just take their word for it Maybe it isn t at all crystal clear to me that their fundamental principles are either fundamental or principles Now hold it I never said that Christians cannot be arrogant Indeed as many other Christians on SRC have stressed before this is a trap that Christians must always be wary about However this does not mean that if you believe in the absolutes established by the Bible you are necessarily being arrogant A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone So I think that your position is The Bible is absolute truth but as we are prone to error in our interpretation we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out what that truth is Did I get that right Not quite You say that according to my stance we cannot reliably determine what is true That is not what I said I say that as fallible human beings we cannot discern the truth with 100 certainty The distinction is subtle yet important When a scientist performs an experiment he can claim that his results are reliable without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could have been made In other words he can admit that he could be mistaken without sacrificing his convictions Nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100 certainty Throughout the centuries philosophers have argued about what we can know with complete certainty and what we cannot Descartes made a step in the right direction when he uttered Cogito ergo sum yet we have not advanced much beyond that Do you believe that other people aside from you exist Do you believe that the computer terminal you are using exists If so can you be absolutely certain about that Are you sure it is not some grand illusion Of course you have no such assurance This does not mean however that for all practical purposes you can be certain that they exist So it is with Christianity The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about absolute morality yet they acknowledge that there is a non zero probability that they are wrong This does not however mean that they should or do abandon these absolutes What s the point of spending all this time claiming and defending absolute truth when we can never know what those truths are and we can never or at least shouldn t act upon them What practical difference can this make As I said we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct This does not mean that we cannot be certain enough in light of the evidence to render all doubts unreasonable Virgilio Dean

have died if the FBI had not taken the actions they did That is the undeniable truth I cried for them Nor would they have died if they had come out with their hands empty That is undeniable truth No it is not It is possible the FBI planned for this to happen and the gunfire heard was the FBI keeping the folks inside I m not proposing this as the way it went down but just to point out that it s not undeniable that if they walked out yesterday they would be alive today You can believe that if you wish It is undeniable however that people have left the compound unharmed and alive earier in the standoff And since their leader was preaching that they would have an apocalypse you can not say undeniably that there wouldn t have been a mass suicide if the FBI had simply stayed outside and waited

that you do not feel for those people as I do You can not say the heartless things you have said if you did I am the heartless bleeding heart You are not making sense No you are the heartless bleeding heart A flaming liberal who cares deeply who feels your pain You seem to have no concern that someone would keep children inside this compound when they had 51 days to let them out That sounds pretty heartless to me You have continually raised this issue without any understanding of the bonds between parent and child It is not easy to say a final goodbye to your children I do not think I could do it either If that makes me heartless so be it How many children do you have I have three I just heard on the news that some of the survivors regret they hadn t stayed in the inferno to prove their loyalty to Koresh This makes me sad and sick It just makes me sad I never claimed Koresh was an angel You seem to say they got what they deserved I do not think this However if they did set the fire which started in more than one place and spread very quickly then they got what they wanted and put into motion themselves they got what they wanted What kind of creature are you that you can believe this Have you ever heard of Jonestown The sad thing is the people inside the compound were the authority worshipers and their only authority was Koresh Howell If these people were able to think for themselves there would likely be a lot more survivors today Koresh preached a fiery apocalypse as early as last year I made the same authority worshiper point about you a few lines back And once again

religious following to the end I m proud that I don t follow such fanatical and non compassionate religions Me too I have already given my life to God If God tells me to lay down my life it will be to save another life You might want to die for whatever purpose but please spare the innocent young ones that has nothing to do with this all I have a hard time just now understanding that Christianity knows about the word compassion Christians do you think the actions today would produce a good picture of your religion Do you judge all Christians by the acts of those who would call themselves Christian and yet are not The BD s contradicted scripture in their actions They were NOT Christian Simple as that Perhaps you have read too much into what the media has portrayed Ask any true believing Christian and you will find that they will deny any association with the BD s Even the 7th Day Adventists have denied any further ties with this cult which was what they were Do you judge

Malcolm Lee Kent ALink KSAND Private activities on the net', 'Subject Re Who s next Mormons and Jews From Casper C Knies Organization Brigham Young University Lines 148 Isaac Kuo writes In article Casper C Knies Gedaliah Friedenberg writes As a Latter day Saint I found John s statement not at all ludicrous Please allow me to explain myself In 1838 the governor of Missouri governor Boggs issued his so called Mormon extermination order The only crime illegal activity the Latter day Saints had committed was their religious affiliation their anti slave stance Missouri still allowed slave practices and their growing numbers influence in Missouri I guess the Mormons got what they deserved because they refused to bow to the will of corrupt and evil secular authorities This disobedience brought upon them persecution murder and finally forced expulsion from their lands and settlements It is significant to remember that these secular positions were held by average people and that at the time almost all Americans were pretty homogeonously Christian It was largely the mainstream Christian s disgust at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred True but that is exactly the problem the Mormon extermination order was issued not just by a Christian it was ALLOWED under the Constitution of the United States which was instituted precisely to prevent incidents like this order from occurring in the first place As I indicated in an earlier posting your irrational hatred is clearly evidenced by individuals like Robert Weiss who could have been Gov Boggs Lieutenant he would have fitted right in drewling et al and seems a modern day occurrence based on results slander persecution misrepresentation lies denying Mormons representation in their own user group etc etc In intent and purpose what really has changed The situation is not entirely different today Many irrational feelings and beliefs are justified through religion I don t think most of them are started because of religion but religion certainly helps justify and perpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification which discourages critical thought True as evidenced by numerous examples as I am sure you re aware In any regard Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities and I don t even discuss how Uthan s were suckered into allowing part of their lands in becoming nerve gas and atomic bomb testing grounds is far from being trusted or righteous Have things really changed for the better I may be a born cynic but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been the case In the early 1980s I believe the late President Kimball lds church leader strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MX Peace Keeper missile maze from being built in Utah yet another inspired decision from secular authorities Fortunately his opposition was influential enough for the feds to back off Do you mean that the secular authorities are some continuous group of people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassing eradicating the Mormons Do you honestly believe that the main reason for using Utah for nuclear testing etc was to get them thar Mormons And what about the majority of Uthan s who aren t Mormons You seem to be searching for enemy Correction the majority of Utahn s ARE Mormon 60 70 I believe up to a 100 in many cities and settlements throughout the Western states conspiracies It is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you badly must have been done primarily for that purpose What I mean is that secular authorities are to be watched as we believe that Satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert truth judgment and justice In addition we believe that the adversary has power to influence the unjust and idolatrous greed for money would be a good example in order to bring about persecution war oppression and evil combinations As an intelligent being don t you suppose that the destroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power As far as Utah is concerned what I pointed out were some horrible examples of environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities which have brought death disease i e the downwinders and environmental contami nation I am hardly paranoid I am just not expecting too much from a secular government that may not share our values and faith and which indeed as Gov Boggs et al may be out to harm and destroy us As a matter of fact prophecies in my church indicate that in future years global persecution against Mormons will so increase in intensity and scope that paraphrasing all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must flee to Zion Zion the pure in heart will be re established in those days and it AIN T our current secular authorities who will rule over it David Koresh did NOT pose a great threat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation and with John I too wonder who or what s next I personally feel that we should try to stop anyone who is a threat to the life of even one person Sure he did not pose a threat to the security of this nation But he did pose a threat to the lives of his followers That much is definite Hmmm definite by whom Until such has been established beyond reason able doubt this alleged threat may have been less than the threat imposed upon him and his followers by the BATF and FBI Who killed who What constitutional right did the ATF officers have to invade upon private land and to force themselves into the compound What REALLY caused the murder of the little children Could it be that the ATF FBI presence has any bearing upon the events How would you interpret the Mt Masada events Blame the Jews What the heck did the Romans do there anyway What business did the ATF FBI has in Waco Texas The Branch Davidians NEVER posed any threat to society This is like asking who REALLY caused the deaths of the Israeli Olympic team in 1976 In that case the police botched the job as well But to lay a heavier burden on them than the terrorists would be a terrible mistake I think the same sort of reasoning applies in this case Certainly if David Koresh chose any peaceful option the ATF and FBI would have complied The responsibility is more his than the authorities Come now at issue is in how much the authorities escalated an otherwise peaceful stand off let s get it over with and force David Koresh to come out By gassing them Were they naive or what They played right into the hands of an apocalyptic thinking individual he had prepared his people for this eventuality for years and not one firetruck or plan was in place to deal with this scenario I feel that the authorities had some responsibility to protect their own citizens even if they were religious zealots and guilty of not paying a 200 gun license Has the BATF become an extension of the local tax collectors David Koresh no doubt will be described as the evil guy by the executioners while the actions of all those valiant and brave officers Characterizing the ATF FBI as executioners is inaccurate and unfair In order to be an executioner the least one must have done is have the intent to kill Que Intrusion into private property with semi s loaded with life ammunition isn t that implicit intent or at least prepared to kill I ask you would the BATF warrant stand up in a civil court of justice I do not mind if criminals such as dangerous drug lords are brought to justice but escalating events to the point of allowing to if not compli city with the destruction of a people

McClary writes Just thought I d clear up a few of the murky areas Actually after surviving being driven out of Nauvoo and later Carthage the Mormons DID fortify Utah They still arm themselves to defend the faith and stockpile food as well They have been involved in quite a lot of illegal activity including multiple and often underage wives for the leaders a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their sect The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking By they you mean the leaders of the lds church I grant you that when Joseph Smith was still alive plenty of accusations were filed most of which had little bearing with reality as evidenced by various verdicts I have studied lds history for 15 years now and I have yet to see prove that the lds leadership was involved in quote illegal activities Plural marriage yes but your charge of underage wives sounds like it could have originated from a tabloid and discredits the high moral standards which characterized these leaders and families unlike as it appears those of David Koresh Joseph Smith started the sect After he and his brother Hyram were murdered in a Nauvoo Il jail cell church membership split over who to follow Initially Smith was considered a prophet just like Mohammed a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews I m led to understand Make no mistake this was no messiah we re talking about in Smith The And neither did he claim he was As the church reflects the moral aptitude of its leaders and especially those of Joseph Smith I have nothing but the highest respect for this inspired man whose only crime was that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision Many have tried to explain the Smith phenomenon away but the bold presence of an 8 5 million member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith s testimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed down father to son After Joseph Smith died his son was only entering his teens Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death The Council of Twelve the Church governing body wasn t of much help here and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake The rest waited for Smith Jr to grow up enough to assume leadership The other claimants to the leadership were soon ignored like Mike Dukakis The rest were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church while the great majority of the membership the Twelve and the various auxiliary organizations chose to accept Brigham Young as the new prophet and leader of the Church If you knew your lds scriptures and doctrine you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in line to fill the prophet Joseph Smith s vacancy he was the senior apostle in the Quorum and various comments made by Joseph indicated that it was Brigham who would lead the latter day exodus to the West Other rightful heirs were either dead Hyrum Smith or excommunicated Oliver Cowdery and while persecutions abounded and intensified Joseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place an empty land beyond the boundaries of the United States at that time This Rekhabite principle pseudographia was well understood and antipated by the great majority of lds faithful and was not questioned by them Granted a couple of do it yourselfers stayed behind unwilling to sacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown but this also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat The church benefitted from this purification process they became even more unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world Both sects practiced the 1 year food stockpile doctrine and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at least owned weapons There is little evidence that they were a militaristic sect given that they tended to move on rather than face large scale opposition Brigham Young having suffered a great deal getting to Salt Lake seems to have been quite justified in making military training a good thing Remember this was far beyond where even the US Army went and these people had nobody to turn to save themselves Just a little context to put this all in perspective BTW since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints one of the largest denominations in the country a sect It didn t splinter from any other religion as did say the Southern Baptists or Methodists So what did the Mormons get It seems that J Edgar Hoover was very impressed with the way they kept secrets They re pledged to defend secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood Many actually do even to the point of suicide What a balloney Suicide is sinful and against the law of God I am not comfortable with this alleged cosiness with Mammon I assure you that many among us reject this attitude categorically Period Our ONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He has appointed to represent Him In any regard to read this TRASH about suicide and atone for sins with blood is yet another insulting misrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for The RLDS the Reorganized LDS are friendly rivals of the LDS and delight in telling stories about them which generates quick retorts from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time At no time have I ever even heard this hinted at I m taking it with a salt block Make it a really big salt mountain with a glacier on top So he hired virtually no one but Mormons until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the Church of Later Day Saints Though J Edgar is finally gone the FBI personnel especially the field agents are still heavily Mormon I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI s treatment of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical Preposterous Even if this were true reliable data please I am convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes of honor and conduct that s why they were selected for in the first place remember Besides one of our Articles of Faith STRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion and that all people are free to worship how where or what they may If it s true there would be little affect LDS and RLDS philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true Church as set down by Jesus but that God will judge each on his own merits In addition the RLDS also contend and the LDS may as well that ignorance of the True Way tm is an excuse You can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected it In short LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to Buddhists secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they will not be penalized for ignorance It is more likely that Hoover liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade alcohol tobacco hot drink like coffee or tea and the like These people are the salt of the Earth and as such are more easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them A good explanation I can accept that You are right that lds people are sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon s orders the late president Kimball for example was an exception with his strong opposition of the selection of the MX Peace Keeper missile maze in Utah That s my somewhat educated guess anyway Both sects have splinter groups that don t mirror the masses but these are small and rare and hardly worth noting their common ancestry None of this has any relevance to guns though When a man s religion is used to deny him the right of self protection with the weapons suitable for the job he ll find

receiver for FSK Organization HP Sonoma County SRSD MWTD MID X Newsreader TIN version 1 1 PL9 2 Lines 78 John Ackermann x 2966 wrote My next project is to come up with an IF detector module for fast 112 to 250 kB sec packet radio use No fancy modulation scheme just wide FSK for use at 902 or 1296 MHz I m a bit familiar with the Motorola 3362 chip but I wonder if there are newer designs that might work at higher input frequencies My goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver back end with IF input on one end and an FSK demondulator on the other I m particularly interested in ways to use a higher IF than 10 7 do any current chips work up to say 150MHz with internal downconversion so a normal IF filter can be used Any suggestions John What you describe is very close to what I built and described in the 10th ARRL Computer Network Conference proceedings I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz They are essentially double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz The receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used previouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham Radio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook The MC3356 which includes a VHF converter section could also be used at these speeds There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design of this the MC13056 if I remember rightly While using this would have let me reduce the external IF count on receive it didn t really offer all that much help on transmit so I didn t bother with it The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2 MHz channel but later reduced to half that These 256 kbps radios actually have done quite well in across the bench tests at 384 kbps and speed is pretty much a function of filter design Handling the data stream is another matter entirely Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a beacon test mode While there is not yet end end two way data flow due to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware MIO also shown in the CNC proceedings data is perfect copy at n6gn Even though the data clock is currently at about half speed the a 2 kbytes of the test text chapter 55 of Isaiah takes only a little over 1 8 of a second I ve been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in and get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable Borland IDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the proceedings but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running low on resources of time money and energy If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW ID after the text on the mark side at 904 740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma Mtn and Black Mtn overlooking Si valley The antenna is horizontally polarized I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly approach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and you might want to carefully consider your target If you can t arrange your paths such that you have complete line of sight I think you ll want to address the inter symbol interference caused by multipath and probably link C N budgets if paths are very far from LOS For more details see the 10th CNC I m currently working on a spread spectrum direct conversion design to address some of these problems I d be glad to

facts that I think the most important are these 1 If Jesus didn t rise from the dead then he must have done something else equally impressive in order to create the observed amount of impact 2 Nobody ever displayed the dead body of Jesus even though both the Jewish and the Roman authorities would have gained a lot by doing so it would have discredited the Christians And the two simplest refutations are these 1 What impact The only record of impact comes from the New Testament I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate and that the recorded impact actually happened I find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse an earthquake a temple curtain being torn etc The earliest written claim we have of Jesus resurrection is from the Pauline epistles none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event 2 It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen by disciples or by graverobbers Don t bother with the point about the guards it only appears in one gospel and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave robbing charge The New Testament does record that Jews believed the body had been stolen If there were really guards they could not

hands of men and they will kill Him and when He has been killed He will rise three days later Mark 10 34 And they will mock Him and spit upon Him and scourge Him and kill Him and three days later He will rise again Mark 12 26 But regarding the fact that the dead rise again have you not read in the book of Moses in the passage about the burning bush how God spoke to him saying I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob Luke 18 33 and after they have scourged Him they will kill Him and the third day He will rise again Luke 24 46 and He said to them Thus it is written that the Christ should suffer and rise again from the dead the third day John 11 25 Jesus said to her I am the resurrection and the life he who believes in Me shall live even if he dies John 20 9 For as yet they did not understand the Scripture that He must rise again from the dead Acts 17 3 explaining and giving evidence that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead and saying This Jesus whom I am proclaiming to you is the Christ The WITNESS Of The APOSTLE PAUL 1 Corinthians 15 1 26 1 Now I make known to you brethren the gospel which I preached to you which also you received in which also you stand 2 by which also you are saved if you hold fast the word which I preached to you unless you believed in vain 3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures 4 and that He was buried and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures 5 and that He appeared to Cephas then to the twelve 6 After that He appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time most of whom remain until now but some have fallen asleep 7 then He appeared to James then to all the apostles 8 and last of all as it were to one untimely born He appeared to me also 9 For I am the least of the apostles who am not fit to be called an apostle because I persecuted the church of God 10 But by the grace of God I am what I am and His grace toward me did not prove vain but I labored even more than all of them yet not I but the grace of God with me 11 Whether then it was I or they so we preach and so you believed 12 Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead 13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead not even Christ has been raised 14 and if Christ has not been raised then our preaching is vain your faith also is vain 15 Moreover we are even found to be false witnesses of God because we witnessed against God that He raised Christ whom He did not raise if in fact the dead are not raised 16 For if the dead are not raised not even Christ has been raised 17 and if Christ has not been raised your faith is worthless you are still in your sins 18 Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished 19 If we have hoped in Christ in this life only we are of all men most to be pitied 20 BUT NOW CHRIST HAS BEEN RAISED FROM THE DEAD the first fruits of those who are asleep 21 For since by a man came death by a man also came the resurrection of the dead 22 For as in Adam all die so also in Christ all shall be made alive 23 But each in his own order Christ the first fruits after that those who are Christ s at His coming 24 then comes the end when He delivers up the kingdom to the God and

OF JESUS CHRIST S RESURRECTION 1 Jesus s enemies would not have stolen His body because that would have perpetrated the resurrection the very opposite of what they desired 2 Jesus disciples could not have stolen His body because Pontius Pilate established guards to stand watch over the tomb lest His body be stolen 3 Sadly and ironically many of Jesus disciples did not believe in the Resurrection until Jesus had risen from the dead 4 In nearly 20 centuries no body has ever been produced to refute Jesus assertion that He would indeed rise from the dead 5 The probability of being able to perpetrate such a hoax successfully upon the entire world for nearly 20 centuries is astronomically negative', 'From Family Magazine Sysops Subject THE EMPTY TOMB Reply To Family Magazine Sysops Organization St Elizabeth Hospital Youngstown OH Lines 218 THE EMPTY TOMB CAN WE TRUST IT by the late Wilbur M Smith D D 1894 1977 When Jesus was on Earth He made an amazing prediction about Himself and frequently repeated it Let me quote it for you Behold we go up to Jerusalem and the Son of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn Him to death and shall deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify Him and the third day He shall rise again Matthew 20 18 19 Wholly different from the normal experience of men Jesus who had never done anything worthy of death even deserving reproval knew He would die before He was 40 years of age He knew the very city where He would die He knew that the religious leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death He knew that one of His own would betray Him He knew that before His actual death took place He would be mocked and scourged He knew exactly how He would die by crucifixion All this is in itself remarkable But more amazing than the minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted would follow shortly after He was buried that He would rise again He even designated the time on the third day But since it is on this central fact the death and resurrec tion of Jesus Christ that the whole truth or untruth of Chris tianity turns let us examine it more closely The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and ointments was distributed The body was placed in a tomb which had never before been used and a great stone was rolled against the entrance The Jewish authorities fully aware that Jesus had predicted He would rise again had the stone officially sealed and on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the disciples from carrying away the body Early Sunday morning some of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the tomb to further anoint the body To their utter astonishment they found the stone rolled away the body gone They rushed back to tell the disciples Shortly two of Jesus friends Peter and John utterly skeptical about the whole affair came and found the tomb empty just as the women had said Even the guards came hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them to guard the tomb that the body was gone Matthew 28 11 How did this tomb become empty One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America professor of New Testament literature in a large theological seminary wrote to the author in answer to my question of how the tomb became empty and wrote it in a letter not marked by bitterness or sarcasm that he could no more explain how the tomb became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the chimney at Christmas time But he didn t realize that Santa Clause never did come down any chimney at Christmas time because there never was a Santa Claus And there is a Jesus He died He was buried in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea and on Sunday the body was gone Those are facts of history No one can escape the responsi bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old Another professor Dr Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University tried to explain the empty tomb by saying what no other scholar in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt that the women went to the wrong tomb The facts are these First so far as we know there was no other tomb nearby to which by mistake they could have gone Second it is contrary to all similar experience for three or more people to forget the place where they have buried their dearest loved one within less than three days Even if the women did miss the tomb when Peter and John came did they too go to the wrong tomb Third were the soldiers guarding the wrong tomb There is of course a record of an attempt to escape the evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself Now when they were going behold some of the watch came into the city and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were done And when they were assembled with the leaders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers Saying Say ye His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we slept And if this come to the governor s ears we will persuade him and secure you So they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying is com monly reported among the Jews until this day Matthew 28 11 15 This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the fact that the tomb was empty You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never questioned but that the tomb was empty They never even went out to see if what the guards had reported was true they knew it was true Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that the tomb was empty the soldiers were told to say that Jesus disciples came and stole the body away while they the soldiers were asleep How could they know what was going on while they were asleep Obviously such testimony would be valueless in any court Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject the explanation the very character and the later history of the disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away the body of Jesus First as Professor Heffern points out the leaders of Judaism in Jerusalem who had put the Lord Jesus to death had nothing to offer to contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His resurrection because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty If there had been trickery here sooner or later it would have been suspected then proved Second surely one of the disciples even most of them would have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent It may be possible to live a lie but men seldom die for a lie and most of these men did The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories it would have lost it power Instead this truth swept the world closed pagan temples won millions of disciples brought hope to a despairing humanity was the very foundation truth of the early church and is today as believable and as freshly glorious as ever But not only did Jesus come alive again He did not disappear to leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to what had happened to Him Instead He appeared to them literally visibly frequently He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning Matthew 28 1 10 later that day to Mary Magdalene alone John 20 11 18 and to Simon Peter also alone Luke 24 34 In the afternoon He walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus Luke 24 13 35 and that night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper room at Jerusalem Mark 16 14 16 Luke 24 36 40 etc A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles probably at the same place John 20 26 28 Once He was seen by above 500 brethren on a mountain in Galilee I Corinthians 15 6 and finally to the apostles just before His ascension Mark 16 19 Luke 24 50 52 Acts 1 3 8 As with the fact of the empty tomb so in regard to these histor ically recorded appearances all kinds of theories have been proposed attempting to deny their literalness But these theories are unreasonable without supporting evidence None has ever won the unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the appearances Moreover while it is true we are living in an age when may of our leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are antisuperanaturalistic let us not forget that some of the greatest thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle Increase Mather president of Harvard Timothy Dwight president of Yale Nathan Lord president of Dartmouth Edward Hitchcock president of Amherst Mark Hopkins president of Williams John Witherspoon president of Princeton these men and countless others have believed it But suppose Christ did rise from the dead what of it What has it to do with my life What has it to do with your life Just this it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ Jesus taught many great truths especially many about Himself He claimed to have come down from God He said He was the way to God He said He was the Son of God who alone knew God perfectly He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life and no one else had it He said that whatever we ask God in His name He would grant it to us Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day He revealed that in these amazing unparalleled predictions He spoke the truth Do you know any reason any good reason why we should not believe that His words are all true The point is does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us that He is none other than the One He claimed to be the Son of God And then of course the fact that Christ rose from the dead testifies that He has broken the power of death and that He will some day raise us also up from the grave as He promised In other words if this Person Jesus Christ the Son of God in all this He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life For He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins His compan ionship and help a joy that no circumstances can ever take away and a hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day Those who have tried it down through the ages and there have been many have given their testimony And we today who believe also know']"

portion has expressed regret about its loss because they like it However when it is pointed out to them that a new motto will not be in the works none have expressed the desire to rape murder pillage etc which you have basically claimed So you are able to convince them individually but could you convince a whole room of them A whole nation As for the atheist portion I know some around here they have all expressed disgust with the motto Some noted being harassed by christians who used the motto to try to seem justified And all would see it gone Yes I d be glad if it were gone to I ve never supported it However I think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored contrasted with what could happen an what may be likely Which Christians designed the motto Does the motto say anything about Jesus Why do you think that it refers only to Christians Christians wrote it christians think that their religion is right and all others are wrong therefore why would they include other religions in the realm of being correct I doubt that any other religions were meant to be included Well I am not clear on the religious convictions of Francis Scott Key the motto can be attributed to him but it is at least clear that he believed in a god And surely there are a few Christians that think as you say but I don t think that most do Do you think that all Christians actively despise other religions Most that I have met haven t and don t do so No christian that I have queried thinks it means anything but them and only them Why not ask some people of other faiths Sorry I would but christianity is just so awfully popular around here Suppose you could ask a few people Well I have asked a Hindu Moselem and a few Jews and all of them think that it is applicable to them Of course I can t say that these people just some that I know pretty well are accurate representations of their faiths It is always a good idea to assume that there were dissenting views on any given issue You are assuming that all the views were the same and nothing leads to this conclusion Without evidence to the contrary I doubt that there were dissenting opinions You claim there were Provide some evidence for your assertion Well I d really like to and I ve tried but I really don t know where to get access to _Congressional Records_ from the 1950 s Can anyone help out here Comparing christians to Nazis Interesting Only in the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their beliefs No again the motto on the money doesn t cost you anything extra However if you abolished the motto we d all have to pay to have all the dies and plates redone Like people paid before to get them changed to have the motto on them You now need to show that there is a good reason to change everything again Also I doubt that they use th3 same plates for more than a year s printing this would make it easy to remove the motto simply make next year s plates without it Your claim evidently is that they will have to pay extra somewhere Provide some evidence for this assertion So are you saying that they redesign the plates each year Anyway your whole argument conveniently deleted I see was that the motto somehow costs us all a lot of money This is just not correct The ones I read didn t mention anything about Jesus I think the issue was concerning the distinction between religion and not How could it be between religious and not religious The motto refers to god it is a religious motto The question is whether or not it is only christian You say it is more I doubt this Provide some evidence for this assertion That is to say the religion of this country and the non religion of the USSR That was what most of those quotes were about and some included all atheists in general as well I don t think that any of the quotes although I seem to have lost them mentioned anything at all about Jesus They advocated religion over non religion A specific religion was not mentioned You have missed this point I said that the motto didn t say anything about anyone in particular That is the motto doesn t imply anything about your particular beliefs It doesn t say that everyone trusts in some form of god only that the nation on the whole does We have been through this before It s obvious it does not include me this much is beyond doubt Your claim again is that the motto refers to more than christians Based on the facts that christianity says all other religions are wrong and because it seems that the motto was written by christians I doubt your claim So you are saying that all Christians must believe that all other religions should be outlawed just because they think they are wrong That s silly I think the Flat Earthers are wrong but I don t advocate their banishment Based on this idea I doubt that any additional expense would even be incurred by removing the motto Provide some evidence for your claim that it would I think that any such cost would be insignificant I mentioned the slight cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by being on our currency Disregarding the digression of the other motto If it is used for harassment and no other purpose has been found for it why should it not be removed Well mottos in general don t really have purposes I don t think it should be removed because I think the benefit would be outweighed by the consequences And do you know what the vote was Were there other opinions Do you think that the main reason the motto was required by law was to bother atheists Do you think that this is what the majority of congress at the time had in mind If you do then show why Again it is the opinion of the people who put it there that I am concerned with Then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress Again it is not necessary that the complete majority shared the purpose of confronting godless Communism with this motto Why not It is the majority that put it there The general public probably does not know about the anti atheist intent of a few people in the 50 s either I daresay more people remember the 50 s than the time when Key wrote the anthem But do they remember the debate surrounding the motto Do they remember that some people intended it to be a message against atheists Why don t you include this in your little survey that you were conducting You claim here that scientists would believe someone s claims I doubt this Provide evidence for your assertion What Should I ask some scientists the probability that something Einstein said about relativity is worthy I mean if Einstein said it there s a good chance that it was right at least at the time As for the courts the method scientists use can be applied I need not agree with the court by default because of a good record You need not agree with them all of the time but you would certainly think that their decisions would be good evidence in favor of some point What But you said you didn t agree with the court because they allowed Congress to attempt to make an amendment prohibiting flag burning If you don t realize that something like this is external to the realm of the court s power then how can I be confident that you know anything about the court s powers I mean if you don t know how the court works how can you participate in a discussion of the court A judge can go to speak before Congress And still you ignore the abortion gag rule as you make your claims on abortion No I think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a Supreme Court Justice to testify before Congress during the consideration of a Constitutional Amendment And in order for the Court to rule on something a case usually must be presented Mushrooms flowers trees buildings signs whatever the analogy is the same Just because something that I might find offensive is present doesn t mean that my rights are being violated We are talking about something put there by people Keith not a mushroom No one caused that mushroom to exist unless you re finding things offensive in a mushroom farm Yes some mushrooms can be planted And I don t appreciate mushrooms on my pizza either This is not the case with the motto And you re ignoring the harassment which is the only known result of the motto and you re ignoring that somewhere along the line people were forced to put the motto there Who was forced to put the motto there What do you mean keith', 'From Fred Rice Subject Re Islam Dress Code for women Organization Monash University Melb Australia Lines 120 In Benedikt Rosenau writes In

have souls in Islam People have said here that some Muslims say that women do not have souls I must admit I have never heard of such a view being held by Muslims of any era I have heard of some Christians of some eras holding this viewpoint but not Muslims Are you sure you might not be confusing Christian history with Islamic history Yes it is supposed to have been a predominant view in the Turkish Caliphate I would like a reference if you have got one for this is news to me Anyhow that women are the spiritual equals of men can be clearly shown from many verses of the Qur an For example the Qur an says For Muslim men and women for believing men and women for devout men and women for true men and women for men and women who are patient and constant for men and women who humble themselves for men and women who give in charity for men and women who fast and deny themselves for men and women who guard their chastity and for men and women who engage much in God s praise For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward Qur an 33 35 Abdullah Yusuf Ali s translation There are other quotes too but I think the above quote shows that men and women are spiritual equals and thus that women have souls just as men do very clearly No it does not It implies that they have souls but it does not say they have souls And it is not given that the quote above is given a high priority in all interpretations One must approach the Qur an with intelligence Any thinking approach to the Qur an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it that women and men are spiritual equals I think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have souls Does it make any sense for something without a soul to be forgiven Or to have a great reward understood to be in the after life I think the usual answer would be no in which case the part saying For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward says they have souls If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven then I have no idea _what_ a soul is As for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority in all interpretations any thinking approach to the Qur an has to give all verses of the Qur an equal priority That is because according to Muslim belief the _whole_ Qur an is the revelation of God in fact denying the truth of any part of the Qur an is sufficient to be considered a disbeliever in Islam Quite similar to you other post even when the Quran does not encourage slavery it is not justified to say that iit forbids or puts an end to slavery It is a non sequitur Look any approach to the Qur an must be done with intelligence and thought It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the Quran s message In a book of finite length it cannot explicitly answer every question you want to put to it but through its teachings it can guide you I think however that women are the spiritual equals of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse and that since women can clearly be forgiven and rewarded they _must_ have souls from the above verse Let s try to understand what the Qur an is trying to teach rather than try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this passage or that passage The misinterpretations of the Qur an based on ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite but the interpretations fully consistent are more limited Let s try to discuss these interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can ignore this bit or that bit for that is just showing how people can try to twist Islam for their own ends something I do not deny but provides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever Fred Rice']"

talking about me or the majority of the people that support it Anyway I think that revenge or fairness is why most people are in favor of the punishment If a murderer is going to be punished people that think that he should get what he deserves Most people wouldn t think it would be fair for the murderer to live while his victim died Revenge Petty and pathetic Perhaps you think that it is petty and pathetic but your views are in the minority We have a local televised hot topic talk show that very recently did a segment on capital punishment Each and every advocate of the use of this portion of our system of jurisprudence cited the main reason for supporting it That bastard deserved it True human compassion forgiveness and sympathy Where are we required to have compassion forgiveness and sympathy If someone wrongs me I will take great lengths to make sure that his advantage is removed or a similar situation is forced upon him If someone kills another then we can apply the golden rule and kill this person in turn Is not our entire moral system based on such a concept Or are you stating that human life is sacred somehow and that it should never be violated This would sound like some sort of religious view I mean how reasonable is imprisonment really when you think about it Sure the person could be released if found innocent but you still can t undo the imiprisonment that was served Perhaps we shouldn t imprision people if we could watch them closely instead The cost would probably be similar especially if we just implanted some sort of electronic device Would you rather be alive in prison or dead in the chair Once a criminal has committed a murder his desires are irrelevant And you still have not answered my question If you are concerned about the death penalty due to the possibility of the execution of an innocent then why isn t this same concern shared with imprisonment Shouldn t we by your logic administer as minimum as punishment as possible to avoid violating the liberty or happiness of an innocent person keith', 'From Keith Allan Schneider Subject Re Cruel was Re Political Atheists Organization California Institute of Technology Pasadena Lines

of the word cruel They spent quite a bit of time on the wording of the Constitution They picked words whose meanings implied the intent We have already looked in the dictionary to define the word Isn

already three times removed from the morality discussion Actually we were discussing the mening of the word cruel and the US Constitution says nothing about that But we were discussing it in relation

Subject Re Political Atheists Organization California Institute of Technology Pasadena Lines 191 NNTP Posting Host punisher caltech edu Jon Livesey writes Much though it might be fun to debate capital punishment itself this is probably the wrong group for it The only relevance here is that you don t seem to be able to tell us what capital punishment actually is and when it is murder That is when you tell us murder is wrong you are using a term you have not yet defined Well I ve said that when an innocent person has been executed this is objectively a murder However who is at blame is another question It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions realizing the risks is to blame There is a probability of killing an innocent person by shooting at random into the air and there is a probability of killing an innocent person when the state administers a system of capital punishment So when you do either you know that they actions you are taking will sooner or later result in the killing of an innocent person Yes but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity Presumably you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this And driving will kill people as will airlines but people continue to do both Driving and flying are not punishments inflicted on unwilling prisoners by Courts They are risks that we take upon ourselves willingly And I argue that our law system is a similar risk Perhaps an innocent person will be punished someday but we work to prevent this In fact many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment of innocents If our own driving kills someone else then sure there is a moral issue I know at least one person who was involved in a fatal accident and they felt vey guilty afterwards But such accidents are to be totally expected given the numner of vehicals on the road Again the blame is on society No I m not This is what you said You were saying that if there were such a false witness that resulted in an innocent person being convicted and killed it would still be the fault of the state since it did the actual killing No I just commented that the state does the killing It does not depend on there being false witnesses How could it The state does the killing even in the case of sincere mistakes Yes but the state is not at fault in such a case The state can only do so much to prevent false witnesses It is possible So what are you trying to say that capital punishment is always murder because of the possibilty of human error invalidating the system I m saying capital punishment is murder period Not because of this that and the other but because it involves taking human life That s my definition of murder I make no appeals to dictionaries or to objective morals Okay so this is what you call murder But the question is whether or not all such murders are wrong Are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong no matter what the circumstances If we as a society decide to murder someone then we should say that and lists our reasons for doing so and live with the moral consequences We should not play word games and pretend that murder isn t murder And that s my opinion about how society ought to be run But this is basically how it works Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution And every member of society shares this blame And most people s definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent which is not involved in an execution is it But we were trying to discuss an objective moral system or at least its possibilty What ramifications does your personal system have on an objective one No we were not discussing an objective moral system I was showing you that you didn t have one because for one thing you were incapable of defining the terms in it for example murder Murder violates the golden rule Executions do not because by allowing it at all society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the innocent victim is We re not talking about reading minds we are just talking about knowing the truth Yes we can never be absolutely certain that we have the truth but the court systems work on a principle of knowing the truth beyond a reasonable doubt Sorry but you simply are not quoting yourself accurately Here is what you said And since we are looking totally objectively at this case then we know what people are thinking when they are voting to execute the person or not If the intent is malicious and unfair then the execution would be murder What you are doing now is to slide into another claim which is quite different The jury being persuaded beyond a serious doubt is not the same as us knowing what is in their minds beyond a serious doubt Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not But in an objective system only the absolute truth matters and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth That is twelve members must be convinced of a truth Moreover a jury which comes from a sufficiently prejudiced background may allow itself to be persuaded beyond a serious doubt on evidence that you and I would laugh at But then if we read the minds of these people we would know that the conviction was unfair But would it be perfectly fair if we could read minds If we assume that it would be fair if we knew the absolute truth why is it so much less fair in your opinion if we only have a good approximation of the absolute truth It s not a question of fairness Your claim which I have quoted above is a claim about whether we can know it was fair so as to be able to distinguish capital punishnment from murder Yes while we could objectively determine the difference if we knew all possible information we can t always determine the difference in our flawed system I think that our system is almost as good as possible but it still isn t objectively perfect You see it doesn t matter if we know it is fair or not Objectively it is either fair or it is not Now there s a huge difference If we can read minds we can know and if we cannot read minds we can know nothing The difference is not in degree of fairness but in what we can know But what we know has no effect on an objective system I think it is possible to produce a fairly objective system if we are clear on which goals it is supposed to promote I m not going to waste my time trying to devise a system that I am pretty sure does not exist Why are you so sure I simply want people to confront reality My reality remember Why is your reality important In this case the reality is that ideal theories apart we can never know even after the fact about the fairness of the justice system For every innocent person released from Death Row there may have been a dozen innocent people executed or a hundred or none at all We simply don t know But we can assume that the system is fairly decent at least most likely And you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a totally ideal and objective system Now what are we going to do On the one hand we can pretend that we have an ideal theory and that we can know things we can never know and the Justie System is fair and that we can wave a magic wand and make certain types of killing not murder and go on our way Well we can have an ideal system but the working system can not be ideal We can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to the ideal system as possible On the other hand we can recognize that all Justice has a small we hope probability of punishing the innocent and that in the end we do bear moral responsibility even for the probabilistic consequences of the systems we set up and then say Well here we go murdering again Maybe some of us will even say Gee I wonder if all this is strictly necessary Yes we all bear the responsibility Most people seem willing to do this I think that the second is preferable in that if requires people to face the moral consequences of what we do as a society instead of sheltering ourselves from them by magic ceremonies and word games We must realize the consequences of all our actions Why do you keep separating the justice system from the pack And lest I forget I also don t think we have an objective moral system and I believe I only have to take that idea seriously when someone presents evidence of it I don t think our country has an objective system but I think such an objective system can exist in theory Without omniscience an objective system is not possible in practice keith']"

compatability RATIONALE Microsoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems or operating environments for those who wish to argue about the meaning of an OS The family ranges from Modular Windows through Windows 3 1 and Windows for Workgroups to Windows NT at the high end To date Microsoft has shipped over 50 000 beta copies and pre release SDKs of Windows NT the actual release is slated for May June 93 While Windows NT has an entirely new design internally it shares an application programming interface with the other members of the Windows family its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win dows 3 1 and the Win32s API subset Win32 less threads networking and security can be used to create 32 bit applications for Windows 3 1 The user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows 3 1 with the addition of logins and a few other features It uses Program Manager File Manager and other applets and generally pre sents an identical appearance to the user Many of the announced Windows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3 1 apps and NT also runs existing 3 1 applications Thus it appears logical that Windows NT should

win32 The following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as well as Windows 3 1 comp os ms windows announce comp os ms windows advocacy In conclusion the only clear argument for the separation of the Windows 3 1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal structures of Windows 3 1 and Windows NT And yet operating systems such as OS 2 Macintosh OS Xenix and Coherent all have undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate newsgroup hierarchies Further Windows 3 1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 when the fully 32 bit protected mode and with DOS built in next generation Windows Chicago debuts next year surely it should remain in the same hierarchy And what then would be the jus tification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions

recall Anyone know what this is That is it Thanks a heap Alan Windows NT is a giant Windows Operating System Unline Win3 1 it does not run on top of DOS It is its own OS with Billy Gates assures us true multi tasking multithreading meets DOD security specs will run win3 1 programs as well as DOS programs has multi processor support and is primarily a Server program It s overhead is too high for it to be economical for most users It also runs OS 2 character based apps and POSIX apps The DOS 16bit and 32 bit windows apps run in a windows 32 bit subsystem If you consider the fact that NT has the Lanman redirectors built in support for TCP IP built in support for NETBEUI comes with TCP utils like ping and an ftp client etc applications like schedule and a 32 bit version of msmail the storage argument isnt an issue Speaking of overhead it requires at least a 386 with 16 megs of RAM It iwll run with 12 but that s like running OS 2 2 0 with 4 megs And that s just to run it Also I have heard that the system files take up 30 50 Megs and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig The SKD is distributed on CD ROM I ran it on a 486 with 8MRAM and it did a ton of disk swapping with a 19M virtual memory paging file It functioned but it crawled this was the OCT build I upgraded the machine to 16M and the performance is good At that point I installed the March Build Consider they are probably still working on the feature set and havent done a lot of fine tuning to the code yet Chicogo is what I want to use It is like NT a true OS with thrue multitasking and multithreading but has much smaller hardware requirements and does not meet DOD security specs but that s okay since it will probably be more of a client OS there are a few otehr differences but those are the main ones There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August The Chicogo and NT development groups at Micro oft are in intense competition so it is said However I think a different relationship will arise NT will be the server N etowrk T echonology Chicogo will be the client machine It is entirely possible for different OS s to work together partly because Chicogo is just a small NT think of it that way anyway Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS so don t scorn the concept Anyway don t expect it soon Windows 4 and DOS 7 are supposed to be released next year read see it in 95 so I expect that Chicogo won t be out til 96 I have little info on Chicago so I cant make a comparison Is it in Beta Is there anyone out there who has tested both and cares to make a comparison Just my 0 02 ALN']"

Science and methodology was Homeopathy tradition Summary Science is not mere methodology Organization University of Hawaii Mathematics Dept Expires Sat 1 May 1993 10 00 00 GMT Lines 85 In article Russell Turpin writes I wrote Or to use a phrasing that I think is more accurate science is the investigation of phenomena that avoids methods and reasoning that are known to be erroneous from past foul ups In article writes I can agree with this if you are talking about the less fundamental aspects of scientific method In fact I don t see the alternative as I don t think that the fundamentals are capable of experimental investigation In saying this I am agreeing with the work of people like Kuhn 1970 Feyerabend 1981 and Lakatos 1972 While methodology cannot be subject to the same kind of experimental investigation as that to which it is applied it can be critically appraised Methodologies can be compared to each other sometimes by the conflicting results they produce This kind of critical appraisal and comparison together with the inappropriateness of existing methodologies for new fields of study is what drives the evolution of methodologies and how we think about them As usual you are missing the whole point Russell because you are not willing to even consider questionning your basic article of faith which is that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highest purpose of science is to avoid making mistakes This is like saying that the most important aspect of business management is accurate bookkeeping If science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes it would be a poor thing indeed What was the methodology of Darwin What was the methodology of Einstein What was for that matter the methodology of Jenner and Pasteur In an earlier article Russell Turpin writes None of the foregoing should be read as meaning that we should open the door to practitioners of quackery and psuedo science Modern advocates of homeopathy chiropracty and traditional Chinese medicine receive little respect because for the most part they use methods and reasoning that the kind of research Lee Lady recommends has shown to be terribly faulty This does not imply that all their treatments are ineffective It does imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are incapable of discovering which treatments are effective and which are not First of all I think you are arguing against a straw man because I don t think that anyone here is arguing that quackery pseudo science homeopathy chiropracty and traditional Chinese medicine should be accepted as science I in particular think the basic ideas of homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky What some of us do believe however is that some of these things including some of the flaky ideas are deserving of serious scientific attention If in fact it were true as you have stated above that those who do not use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is effective and what is not then science today would not exist For all of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose methodology by current standards was seriously flawed It is certainly true that as methodology improves we need to re examine those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies It is also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on those early methodologies needs to be re examined in a more rigorous fashion by those qualified to do so credibly But to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double blind studies is capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly be worthy of serious investigation this truly marks one s attitude as doctrinaire cultist This attitude is not compatible with a belief in reason In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects', 'From Lee Lady Subject Re Science and methodology was Homeopathy tradition Summary Ultimately ideas come from exploration and informal thinking Organization University of Hawaii Mathematics Dept Expires Mon 10 May 1993 10 00 00 GMT Lines 65 In article Gary Merrill writes In article Mark Fulk writes Flights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common The crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies they aren t of any use unless they make you do some experiments Simple example Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments He got very excited But why do you characterize this as a flight of fancy or a fantasy While I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here it appears obvious that his speculation for lack of a better or more neutral word was at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance of current theory coupled with his observations It would appear that something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation into that theory or to tailor the theory to cover the observation Whether a scientific idea comes while one is staring out the window or dreaming or having a fantasy or watching an apple fall Newton or sitting in a bath Archimedes it is ultimately the result of a lot of intense scientific thinking done beforehand Letting one s mind roam freely and giving rein to one s intuition can be a useful way of coming up with new ideas but only when one has done a lot of rational analysis of the problem first Scientific intuition is not something one is born with It is something that one learns Maybe we don t understand completely how it is learned but training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of the key elements in developing it Informal exploration is also often an important element in finding new scientific ideas One thinks for instance of Darwin s naturalistic studies in the Galapagos islands which led him to the ideas for the theory of evolution This is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizes empirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informal exploration as important scientific work I agree that mere speculation does not deserve to be called science I also think that mere empirical studies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a very poor kind of science In article Russell Turpin writes I think that Lee Lady and I are talking at cross purposes Lady seems concerned with the contrast between great science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre science that makes smaller steps In most of this thread I have been concerned with the difference between what is science and what is not I don t think that science should be defined in a way that some of the activities that lead to really important science namely thinking and informal exploration are not recognized as scientific work In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects', 'From Lee Lady Subject Re Science and Methodology Summary Merely avoiding mistakes doesn t get you anywhere Organization University of Hawaii Mathematics Dept Expires Mon 10 May 1993 10 00 00 GMT Lines 57 In article Michael Holloway writes In article Lee Lady writes I would also like to point out that most of the arguments about science in sci med sci psychology etc are not about cases where people are rejecting scientific argument evidence proof They are about cases where no adequate scientific research has been done In some cases there is quite a bit of evidence but it isn t in a format to fit doctrinaire conceptions of what science is Here it is again This indicates confusion between proof and the process of doing science You are making precisely one of the points I wanted to make I fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the process of science and the end result As an end result of science one wants to get results that are objectively verifiable But there is nothing objective about the process of science If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit to homeopathic remedies this would certainly be valuable information But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science This is where you and I disagree with Turpin In order to have science one must have a theoretical structure that makes sense not a mere collection of empirically validated random hypotheses Experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science but they are merely the culmination of scientific research The most important part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING Without this one does not have any hypotheses worth testing No hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data Nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you re shaving or looking out the window At least not unless you ve done a lot of really good thinking beforehand The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology It depends on the quality of their THINKING It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical studies And it bothers me even more that there are many fields such as certain parts of psychology where there seems to be no thinking at all but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses And I m especially offended by Russell Turpin s repeated assertion that science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes Simply avoiding mistakes doesn t get you anywhere In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects']"

specified one it would be active and automatically installed To get multiple accelerators on a single menu item I d do something like menuItem accelerators override Ctrl Key M fire Shift Key L fire

C Code Contest Guidelines Hints and Comments X XCopyright c Landon Curt Noll Larry Bassel 1993 XAll Rights Reserved Permission for personal education or non profit use is Xgranted provided this this copyright and notice are included in its entirety Xand remains unaltered All other uses must receive prior permission in writing Xfrom both Landon Curt Noll and Larry Bassel X XABOUT THIS FILE X X This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X the International Obfuscated C Code Contest IOCCC for short X X This is not the IOCCC rules though it does contain comments about X them The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions X Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X allowed Even so you are safer if you remain within the guidelines X X You should read the current IOCCC rules prior to submitting entries X The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993 X X The entry format is better for us anyway The program mkentry c X has been updated See ENTRY FORMAT X X We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X compiler Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers X fits are no longer permitted Some of the new issues deal with X non integral array types variable number of arguments C preprocessor X directives and the exit function See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS X X You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests See X FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners X X Keep in mind that rules change from year to year so some winning entries X may not be valid entries this year What was unique and novel one year X might be old the next year X X An entry is usually examined in a number of ways We typically apply X a number of tests to an entry X X look at the original source X convert ANSI tri graphs to ASCII X C pre process the source ignoring include lines X C pre process the source ignoring define and include lines X run it through a C beautifier X examine the algorithm X lint it X compile it X execute it X X You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests X You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X cleaned up by the C pre processor and a C beautifier X X Your entry need not do well under all or in most tests In certain X cases a test is not important Entries that compete for the X strangest most creative source layout need not do as well as X others in terms of their algorithm On the other hand given X two such entries we are more inclined to pick the entry that X does something interesting when you run it X X We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules As such we leave X the contest open for creative rule interpretation As in real life X programming interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X is important For this reason we often award worst abuse of the X rules to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way X X If you do plan to abuse the rules we suggest that you let us know X in the remarks section Please note that an invitation to abuse X is not an invitation to break We are strict when it comes to the X 3217 byte size limit Also abusing the entry format tends to X annoy more than amuse X X We do realize that there are holes in the rules and invite entries X to attempt to exploit them We will award worst abuse of the rules X and then plug the hole next year Even so we will attempt to use X the smallest plug needed if not smaller X X Check out your program and be sure that it works We sometimes make X the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem particularly X in or near the final round On the other hand we have seen some X of the best entries fall down because they didn t work X X We tend to look down on a prime number printer that claims that X 16 is a prime number If you do have a bug you are better off X documenting it Noting this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X of a prime by mistake would save the above entry And sometimes X a strange bug feature can even help the entry Of course a correctly X working entry is best X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES X X Doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become old We X tend to see thru masses of defines due to our pre processor tests X that we apply Simply abusing defines or Dfoo bar won t go as far X as a program that is more well rounded in confusion X X Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code and so do we X X define d define X d foo don t expect this to turn into define foo X X int i X j don t use such implicit type declaration X int k X X We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler If you X must use non ANSI C such as K R C you must avoid areas that result in X compile link errors for ANSI C compilers X X Unfortunately ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type X Thus the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed X X int i X char c X i c use c i instead X i 3 string use string i 3 instead X X If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X arguments be careful Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X of ways Because of this a number of operations using va_list are X not portable and must not be used X X assigning a non va_list variable to from a va_list variable X casting a non va_list variable into from a va_list variable X passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non va_list arg X passing a non va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X performing arithmetic on va_list variables X using va_list as a structure or union X X In particular do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char s X X Avoid using varargs h use stdarg h instead X X If you use C preprocessor directives define if ifdef X the leading must be the first character on a line While some X C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading many do not X X Because the exit function returns void on some systems entries X must not assume that it returns an int X X Small programs are best when they are short obscure and concise X While such programs are not as complex as other winners they do X serve a useful purpose They are often the only program that people X attempt to completely understand For this reason we look for X programs that are compact and are instructional X X One line programs should be short one line programs say around 80 X bytes long Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion X X We tend to dislike programs that X X are very hardware specific X are very OS or Un x version specific X index strchr differences are ok but socket streams specific X code is likely not to be X dump core or have compiler warnings X it is ok only if you warn us in the remark header item X won t compile under both BSD or SYS V Un x X abusing the build file to get around the size limit X obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri graphs X are longer than they need to be X are similar to previous winners X are identical to previous losers X X Unless you are cramped for space or unless you are entering the X best one liner category we suggest that you format your program X in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines X X The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X limit It is one thing to make use of a several D s to help out X but it is quite another to use 200 bytes of D s in order to X try and squeeze the source under the size limit You should feel X free to make use of the build file space but you are better off X if you show some amount of restraint X X We allowed whitespace and in certain cases or do not impact X your program size up to a certain point because we want to get X away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters X X Given two versions of the same program one that is a compact blob X of code and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X program we tend to favor the second version Of course a third X version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X and or obfuscated way would definitely win over the first two X X We suggest that you avoid trying for the smallest self replicating X program We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X to be the smallest There is nothing wrong with self replicating X programs In fact a number of winners have been self replicating X You might want to avoid the claim of smallest lest we or others X know of a smaller one X X X client entries should be as portable as possible Entries that X adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored Don t X depend on a particular type of display For example don t depend X on color or a given size Don t require backing store X X X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X software that is not in wide spread use We ask that such X client X entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X Athena widget set libX11 a libXaw a libXmu a and libXt a X Don t use M tif Xv ew or OpenL ok toolkits since not everyone X has them Avoid depending on a particular window manager Not X everyone has X11r5 and some people are stuck back in X11r4 or X earlier so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5 Better X yet try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems X X X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X Xdefaults If you must do so be sure to note the required lines X in the remark section X X We like programs that X X are as concise and small as they need to be X do something at least quasi interesting X pass lint without complaint not a requirement but it is nice X are portable X are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X make us laugh and or throw up X X Some types of programs can t excel in some areas Of course your X program doesn t have to excel in all areas but doing well in several X areas really does help X X We freely admit that interesting creative or humorous comments in X the remark section helps your chance of winning If you had to X read of many twisted entries you too would enjoy a good laugh or two X We think the readers of the contest winners do as well X X Be creative X X XENTRY FORMAT X X In order to help us process the many entries we must request your X assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way This format X in addition allows us to quickly separate information about the X author from the program itself see JUDGING PROCESS X X We have provided the program mkentry as an example of how to X format entries You should be aware of the following warning that X is found in mkentry c X X This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules Every X attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X an entry that conforms to the contest rules In all cases X where this program differs from the contest rules the X contest rules will be used Be sure to check with the X contest rules before submitting an entry X X You are not required to use mkentry It is convenient however X as it attempts to uuencode the needed files and attempt to check X the entry against the size rules X X If you have any suggestions comments fixes or complaints about X the mkentry c program please send Email to the judges see below X X The following is a sample entry X X entry Xrule 1993 Xfix n Xtitle chonglab Xentry 0 Xdate Mon Mar 1 08 45 20 1993 Xhost Un x v6 pdp11 45 X 2 9BSD pdp11 70 X remark X This is a

Typically the build file should assume that the source is prog c X and will compile into prog If an entry wins we will rename X its source and binary to avoid filename collision By tradition X we use the name of the entry s title followed by an optional X digit in case of name conflicts X X If the above entry somehow won the least likely to win award X we would use chonglab c and chonglab X X If your entry depends on or requires that your build source X and or binary files be a particular name please say so in the X remark section If this case applies it would be be helpful X if you did one of the following X X Tell us how to change the filename s in your entry X X Have the build file make copies of the files For example X X cc prog c o special_name need special binary X X or rm f special_src c need special source X cp prog c special_src c X cc special_src c o special_name X X or rm f special_build need special build X tail 4 build special_build X sh special_build X X Assume that we will use the entry title Send us a version of X your build program files that uses the name convention You X should uuencode these files in data sections X X If your entry needs to modify its source info or binary files X please say so in the remark section You should try to avoid X touching your original build source and binary files You should X arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify This X will allow people to re generate your entry from scratch X X Remember that your entry may be built without a build file We X typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile If the X build file must exist say so in the remark section X X If your entry needs special info files you should uuencode them X into info sections In the case of multiple info files X use multiple info sections If no info files are needed X then skip the info section X X Info files are intended to be input or detailed information that X does not fit well into the remark section For example an X entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X programs for the user to compile An entry might want to include a X lengthy design document that might not be appropriate for a X hints file X X Info files should be used only to supplement your entry For X example info files may provide sample input or detailed X information about your entry Because they are supplemental X the entry should not require them exist X X In some cases your info files might be renamed to avoid name X conflicts If info files should not be renamed for some reason X say so in the remark section X X Info files must uudecode into the current directory If they X absolutely must be renamed or moved into a sub directory say X so in the remark section X X When submitting multiple entries be sure that each entry has X a unique entry number from 0 to 7 Your first entry should X have entry number 0 X X With the exception of the header all text outside of the entry X format may be ignored That is don t place text outside of the X entry and expect the judges to see it Our decoding tools aren t X AI progs If you need tell the the something put it in the X remark section or send a Email to the judges at X X apple pyramid sun uunet hoptoad judges not the address for X submitting entries X X The date should be given with respect to UTC Some systems refer X to this as GMT or GMT0 The format of the date should be that as X returned by asctime in the C locale An example of such a string is X X Thr Apr 01 00 47 00 1993 X X This format is similar to the output of the date 1 command The X string does not include the timezone name before the year On many X systems one of the following command will produce a similar string X X date u a h d T 19 y X date u sed e s 19 0 9 0 9 1 X sh c TZ UTC date sed e s 19 0 9 0 9 1 X sh c TZ GMT date sed e s 19 0 9 0 9 1 X sh c TZ GMT0 date sed e s 19 0 9 0 9 1 X X You are allowed to update fix revise your entry To do so set X the fix line in the entry section to y instead of n X Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X as well as these are used to determine which entry is to be X replaced X X XJUDGING PROCESS X X Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll X X Entries are unpacked into individual directories The Email message X is unpacked into individual files each containing X X entry section X all author sections X all info sections X build section X program section X any other text including the Email message headers X X Prior to judging the any other text file is scanned to be sure X it does not contain useful information or in case the entry was X malformed and did not unpack correctly Information from the X author sections are not read until the judging process is X complete and then only from entries that have won an award X X The above process helps keep us biased for against any one particular X individual We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X until the final awards are given We like the surprise of finding X out in the end who won and where they were from X X We attempt to keep all entries anonymous unless they win an award X Because the main prize of winning is being announced we make all X attempts to send non winners into oblivion We remove all non winning X files and shred all related paper By tradition we do not even X reveal the number of entries that we received for the curious X we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X winners at talks X X After the Usenix announcement we attempt to send Email to the X authors of the winning entries One reason we do this is to give X the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X entry They are given the chance to correct mistakes typos We X often accept their suggestions comments about our remarks as well X This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world X X Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds During a round X the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles X the pile that advances on to the next round and the pile that does X not We also re examine the entries that were eliminated in the X previous round Thus an entry gets at least two readings X X A reading consists of a number of actions X X reading the entry section X reading the uudecoded build section X reading the uudecoded program section X reading the uudecoded info section s if any X passing the source thru the C pre processor X shipping over any include files X performing a number of C beautify cleanup edits on the source X passing the beautified source thru the C pre processor X shipping over any include files X X In later rounds other actions are performed X X linting the source X compiling building the source X running the program X performing misc tests on the source and binary X X Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries entries X are judged on an individual basis An entry is set aside because it X does not in our opinion meet the standard established by the round X When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries we begin to form X award categories Entries begin to compete with each other for awards X An entry often will compete in several categories X X The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X we receive A typical category list might be X X best small one line program X best small program X strangest most creative source layout X most useful obfuscated program X best game that is obfuscated X most creatively obfuscated program X most deceptive C code X best X client see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES X best abuse of ANSI C X worst abuse of the rules X anything else so strange that it deserves an award X X We do not limit ourselves to this list For example a few entries are so X good bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round X We will invent awards categories for them if necessary X X In the final round process we perform the difficult tasks of X reducing the remaining entries typically about 25 down to 8 or 10 X winners Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X make it The selection of the winners out of the final round is X less clear cut X X Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win but is beat out X by a similar but slightly better entry For this reason it is X sometimes worthwhile to re enter an improved version of an entry X that failed to win in a previous year This assumes of course X that the entry is worth improving in the first place X X More often that not we select a small entry usually one line a X strange creative layout entry and an entry that abuses the contest X rules in some way X X In the end we traditionally pick one entry as best Sometimes such X an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry More often the X best is picked because it does well in a number of categories X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS X X The first announcement occurs at a Summer Usenix conference By tradition X this is done during the latter part of the UUNET IOCCC BOF just prior to X the Berkeley BSD and BSDI BOF X X Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups X X comp lang c comp unix wizards alt sources X X In addition pointers to these postings are

omniscient being is going to perform the feat of definitely terming actions right or wrong If you were omniscient you d know who exactly did what and with what purpose in mind Then with a particular goal in mind you sould be able to methodically judge whether or not this action was in accordance with the general goal I don t think you ve show the existence of any objective moral system They exist but in practice they are difficult to perfectly emulate I mean you understand the concept of an objective system right I thought you were explaining it to us I certainly don t understand what you are explaining In an objective system there are known goals Then actions are judged as either being compatible with these goals or not Simple The problem with most systems in current practice is that the goals differ That is the goals of each society are different Note that an objective system is not necessarily an inherent one The concept of innocence is dependent on whether certain actions are right or wrong and this depends on the moral system But if we have an objective system then someone can be deemed innocent or not quite easily by an omniscient person Anyway I think I cleared up the recursive definition of murder because no one is complaining about it I don t think it solves anything to speculate where we would be if we did have an objective moral system The question is still whether you can even say what one is I ve said it many many times And for what it s worth I don t think you cleared up anything concerning murder Which part do you have a problem with What do you mean by harmed Is it harm if you have to spend your existence metabolising food for another species Oh most moral systems would be considered only within a species It is okay for us to enslave other animals right But not humans Of course ideally perhaps we wouldn t even have to bother any other animals One the first point it s wrong to enslave humans according to my persoanl moral system On the second point I m a vegetarian But we can enslave the animals right But just not kill them Or are you a vegetarian for health reasons So are you a vegetarian No I fail to see how my personal views are relevant anyway Is it wrong to eat animals in your personal moral system Of course not It seems perfectly valid to kill members of other species for food It might be nice though if the other animals were not made to suffer For instance a cow in a field lives out its life just about the same way it would in the wild They seem happy enough However the veal youngsters aren t treated very well How about an objective moral system I don t know What is the goal of this particular system There is no inherent system How about a natural moral system Nope Again it seems okay to kill other species for food keith', 'From Keith Allan Schneider Subject Re Political Atheists Organization California Institute of Technology Pasadena Lines 54 NNTP Posting Host punisher caltech edu reference line trimmed Jon Livesey writes There is a good deal more confusion here You started off with the assertion that there was some objective morality and as you admit here you finished up with a recursive definition Murder is objectively immoral but eactly what is murder and what is not itself requires an appeal to morality Yes Now you have switch targets a little but only a little Now you are asking what is the goal What do you mean by goal Are you suggesting that there is some objective goal out there somewhere and we form our morals to achieve it Well for example the goal of natural morality is the survival and propogation of the species Another example of a moral system is presented within the Declaration of Independence which states that we should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness You see to have a moral system we must define the purpose of the system That is we shall be moral unto what end Murder is certainly a violation of the golden rule And I thought I had defined murder as an intentional killing of a non murderer against his will And you responded to this by asking whether or not the execution of an innocent person under our system of capital punishment was a murder or not I fail to see what this has to do with anything I never claimed that our system of morality was an objective one I thought that was your very first claim That there was some kind of objective morality and that an example of that was that murder is wrong If you don t want to claim that any more that s fine Well murder violates the golen rule which is certainly a pillar of most every moral system However I am not assuming that our current system and the manner of its implementation are objectively moral I think that it is a very good approximation but we can t be perfect And by the way you don t seem to understand the difference between arbitrary and objective If Keith Schneider defines murder to be this that and the other that s arbitrary Jon Livesey may still say Well according to my personal system of morality all killing of humans against their will is murder and wrong and what the legal definition of murder may be in the USA Kuweit Saudi Arabia or the PRC may be matters not a whit to me Well objective would assume a system based on clear and fundamental concepts while arbitary implies no clear line of reasoning keith', 'From Jon Livesey Subject Re Morality was Re Political Atheists Organization sgi Lines 93 Distribution world NNTP Posting Host solntze wpd sgi com In article Keith Allan Schneider writes Jon Livesey writes Explain to me how instinctive acts can be moral acts and I am happy to listen For example if it were instinctive not to murder Then not murdering would have no moral significance since there would be nothing voluntary about it See there you go again saying that a moral act is only significant if it is voluntary Why do you think this If you force me to do something am I morally responsible for it And anyway humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts Well make up your mind Is it to be instinctive not to murder or not So only intelligent beings can be moral even if the bahavior of other beings mimics theirs You are starting to get the point Mimicry is not necessarily the same as the action being imitated A Parrot saying Pretty Polly isn t necessarily commenting on the pulchritude of Polly You are attaching too many things to the term moral I think Let s try this is it good that animals of the same species don t kill each other Or do you think this is right It s not even correct Animals of the same species do kill one another Or do you think that animals are machines and that nothing they do is either right nor wrong Sigh I wonder how many times we have been round this loop I think that instinctive bahaviour has no moral significance I am quite prepared to believe that higher animals such as primates have the beginnings of a moral sense since they seem to exhibit self awareness Animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily but they don t They do I and other posters have given you many examples of exactly this but you seem to have a very short memory Those weren t arbitrary killings They were slayings related to some sort of mating ritual or whatnot So what Are you trying to say that some killing in animals has a moral significance and some does not Is this your natural morality Are you trying to say that this isn t an act of morality because most animals aren t intelligent enough to think like we do I m saying There must be the possibility that the organism it s not just people we are talking about can consider alternatives It s right there in the posting you are replying to Yes it was but I still don t understand your distinctions What do you mean by consider Can a small child be moral How about a gorilla A dolphin A platypus Where is the line drawn Does the being need to be self aware Are you blind What do you think that this sentence means There must be the possibility that the organism it s not just people we are talking about can consider alternatives What would that imply What do you call the mechanism which seems to prevent

Consultants Cambridge UK Supersedes Lines 632 Archive name atheism logic Alt atheism archive name logic Last modified 5 April 1993 Version 1 4 Constructing a Logical Argument Although there is much argument on Usenet the general quality of argument found is poor This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic in the hope of improving the general level of debate Logic is the science of reasoning proof thinking or inference Concise OED Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not valid or invalid Of course one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly nevertheless a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable The matter is very much open for debate This document merely explains how to use logic given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job Propositions or statements are the building blocks of a logical argument A proposition is a statement which is either true or false for example It is raining or Today is Tuesday Propositions may be either asserted said to be true or denied said to be false Note that this is a technical meaning of deny not the everyday meaning The proposition is the meaning of the statement not the particular arrangement of words used to express it So God exists and There exists a God both express the same proposition An argument is to quote the Monty Python sketch a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition An argument consists of three stages First of all the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated These are called the premises of the argument They are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions Premises or assertions are often indicated by phrases such as because since obviously and so on The phrase obviously is often viewed with suspicion as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises If something doesn t seem obvious to you don t be afraid to question it You can always say Oh yes you re right it is obvious when you ve heard the explanation Next the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference In inference one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted There are various forms of valid inference The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference Inference is often denoted by phrases such as implies that or therefore Finally we arrive at the conclusion of the argument the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference Conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as therefore it follows that we conclude and so on The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference For example Every event has a cause premise The universe has a beginning premise All beginnings involve an event premise This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event inference Therefore the universe has a cause inference and conclusion Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument the terms do not make sense in isolation Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above for example the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated afterwards in support of the conclusion This is perfectly valid if sometimes a little confusing Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument Some statements look like arguments but are not For example If the Bible is accurate Jesus must either have been insane an evil liar or the Son of God This is not an argument it is a conditional statement It does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its conclusion It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws but we ll come to those later Another example God created you therefore do your duty to God The phrase do your duty to God is not a proposition since it is neither true nor false Therefore it is not a conclusion and the sentence is not an argument Finally causality is important Consider a statement of the form A because B If we re interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence the statement is an argument If we re trying to establish the truth of B then it is not an argument it is an explanation For example There must be something wrong with the engine of my car because it will not start This is an argument My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine This is an explanation There are two traditional types of argument deductive and inductive A deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions that is an argument where if the premises are true the conclusion must also be true A deductive argument is either valid or invalid A valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true then the conclusion is true An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid however we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments and about how probable their premises are There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive However we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds This is because of the slightly counter intuitive nature of implication which we must now consider more carefully Obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions However an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions For example All insects have wings premise Woodlice are insects premise Therefore woodlice have wings conclusion Here the conclusion is not true because the argument s premises are false If the argument s premises were true however the conclusion would be true The argument is thus entirely valid More subtly we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises as in All fish live in the sea premise Dolphins are fish premise Therefore dolphins live in the sea conclusion However the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises We can therefore draw up a truth table for implication The symbol denotes implication A is the premise B the conclusion T and F represent true and false respectively Premise Conclusion Inference A B A B F F T If the premises are false and the inference F T T valid the conclusion can be true or false T F F If the premises are true and the conclusion false the inference must be invalid T T T If the premises are true and the inference valid the conclusion must be true A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true A sound argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion Be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy It is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument These pitfalls are known as fallacies In everyday English the term fallacy is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs This is fair enough but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument especially if the argument appears valid or convincing So for the purposes of this discussion we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them The following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM APPEAL TO FORCE The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion It is often used by politicians and can be summarized as might makes right The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer For example Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible All those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM Argumentum ad hominem is literally argument directed at the man The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion This is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it For example Atheism is an evil philosophy It is practised by Communists and murderers Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by showing for example that he is a known perjurer This is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness and not argumentum ad hominem however it does not demonstrate that the witness s testimony is false To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the Argumentum ad Ignorantiam see elsewhere in this list The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent s particular circumstances For example It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food How can you argue otherwise when you re quite happy to wear leather shoes This is an abusive charge of inconsistency used as an excuse for dismissing the opponent s argument This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion For example Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing You re white This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem when one alleges that one s adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests is also known as poisoning the well ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM Argumentum ad ignorantium means argument from ignorance This fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false Or equivalently when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true Note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true a basic scientific principle Examples Of course the Bible is true Nobody can prove otherwise Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist Nobody has shown any proof that they are real Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty Also in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred the absence of such evidence can validly be used to infer that the event did not occur For example A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth The earth does not have a tenth as much water even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles Therefore no such flood occurred In science we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred however ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM This is the Appeal to Pity also known as Special Pleading The fallacy is committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a conclusion accepted For example I did not murder my mother and father with an axe Please don t find me guilty I m suffering enough through being an orphan ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM This is known as Appealing to the Gallery or Appealing to the People To commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people This form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language For example Pornography must be banned It is violence against women The Bible must be true Millions of people know that it is Are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum It consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition the more likely it is that that proposition is correct ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion For example Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God This line of argument is not always completely bogus for example reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject For example we can distinguish quite clearly between Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation and John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent computer Hawking is a physicist and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed Searle is a linguist so it is questionable whether he is well qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT The Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose accidental circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable It is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific For example Christians generally dislike atheists You are a Christian so you must dislike atheists This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules CONVERSE ACCIDENT HASTY GENERALIZATION This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident It occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases For example Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian Therefore all Christians are insincere SWEEPING GENERALIZATION DICTO SIMPLICITER A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC These are known as False Cause fallacies The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause For example I took an aspirin and prayed to God and my headache disappeared So God cured me of the headache The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event For example The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism Therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc It asserts that because two events occur together they must be causally related and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause s of the events PETITIO PRINCIPII This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach Often the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument For example Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office Hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret and will be open to blackmail Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office Note that the argument is entirely circular the premise is the same as the conclusion An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the British Secret Services official ban on homosexual employees Another example is the classic We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so And we know that the Bible is true because it is the word of God COMPLEX QUESTION FALLACY OF INTERROGATION This is the Fallacy of Presupposition One example is the classic loaded question Have you stopped beating your wife The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked This trick is often used by lawyers in cross examination when they ask questions like Where did you hide the money you stole Similarly politicians often ask loaded questions such as How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue or Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization IGNORATIO ELENCHI The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion For example a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of Christianity are undoubtably true If he then argues at length that Christianity is of great help to many people no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true Sadly such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light EQUIVOCATION Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument For example What could be more affordable than free software But to make sure that it remains free that users can do what they like with it we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable AMPHIBOLY Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing ACCENT Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning In this case the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized For example consider We should not speak ILL of our friends and We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION One fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole For example The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components and is therefore very lightweight The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items For example A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus Therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses FALLACY OF DIVISION The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition Like its opposite it exists in two varieties The first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts For example You are studying at a rich college Therefore you must be rich The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item For example Ants can destroy a tree Therefore this ant can destroy a tree THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT This argument states that should one event occur so will other harmful events There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event For example If we legalize marijuana then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we ll have a nation full of drug addicts on welfare Therefore we cannot legalize marijuana A IS BASED ON B FALLACIES IS A TYPE OF FALLACIES These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar Examples Isn t history based upon faith If so then isn t the Bible also a form of history Islam is based on faith Christianity is based on faith so isn t Islam a form of Christianity Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry so aren t dogs a form of cat AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT This fallacy is an argument of the form A implies B B is true therefore A is true To understand why it is a fallacy examine the truth table for implication given earlier DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT This fallacy is an argument of the form A implies B A is false therefore B is false Again the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa the latter has the form A implies B A is false therefore B is false where A does NOT in fact imply B at all Here the problem is not that the implication is invalid rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce anything about B CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL This fallacy is an argument of the form If A then B therefore if B then A ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old or because that s the way it s always been ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM This is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness that those with more money are more likely to be right ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier This fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard An argumentum ad nauseum is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something BIFURCATION Also referred to as the black and white fallacy bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM MANY QUESTIONS This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question NON SEQUITUR A non sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it RED HERRING This fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed so that everyone s attention is diverted away from the points being made towards a different conclusion REIFICATION HYPOSTATIZATION Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition Shifting the burden of proof a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise STRAW MAN The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else s position so that it can be attacked more easily then to knock down that misrepresented position then to conclude that the original position has been demolished It is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made THE EXTENDED ANALOGY The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two different situations in an argument about a general rule constitutes a claim that those situations are analogous to each other This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about anti cryptography legislation I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it Such a position is odious it implies that you would not have supported Martin Luther King Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the struggle for Black liberation How dare you TU QUOQUE This is the famous you too fallacy It occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it For instance You re just being randomly abusive So You ve been

BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE An Introduction to Atheism by mathew This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism Whilst I have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint I would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions some relevant books are listed in a companion article To provide a sense of cohesion and progression I have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist All the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on alt atheism since the newsgroup was created Some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a Christian viewpoint This is because the FAQ files reflect questions which have actually been asked and it is predominantly Christians who proselytize on alt atheism So when I talk of religion I am talking primarily about religions such as Christianity Judaism and Islam which involve some sort of superhuman divine being Much of the discussion will apply to other religions but some of it may not What is atheism Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God Some atheists go further and believe that God does not exist The former is often referred to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strong atheism It is important to note the difference between these two positions Weak atheism is simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of God Strong atheism is a positive belief that God does not exist Please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheists Some atheists believe in the non existence of all Gods others limit their atheism to specific Gods such as the Christian God rather than making flat out denials But isn t disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn t exist Definitely not Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not Which brings us to agnosticism What is agnosticism then The term agnosticism was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876 He defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed strong atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for sure whether God exists Words are slippery things and language is inexact Beware of assuming that you can work out someone s philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic For example many people use agnosticism to mean weak atheism and use the word atheism only when referring to strong atheism Beware also that because the word atheist has so many shades of meaning it is very difficult to generalize about atheists About all you can say for sure is that atheists don t believe in God For example it certainly isn t the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out about the universe So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism There are many philosophical justifications for atheism To find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist it s best to ask her Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions is essentially self contradictory and that it is logically impossible that such a God could exist Others are atheists through scepticism because they see no evidence that God exists But isn t it impossible to prove the non existence of something There are many counter examples to such a statement For example it is quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than all other prime numbers Of course this deals with well defined objects obeying well defined rules Whether Gods or universes are similarly well defined is a matter for debate However assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably impossible there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non existence of God If we assume that something does not exist it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter example If on the other hand we assume that something does exist and if the thing in question is not provably impossible showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing might be found to show that it isn t there Such an exhaustive search is often impractical or impossible There is no such problem with largest primes because we can prove that they don t exist Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist unless we have evidence that they do Even theists follow this rule most of the time they don t believe in unicorns even though they can t conclusively prove that no unicorns exist anywhere To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be tested We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to prove that he doesn t exist anywhere So the sceptical atheist assumes by default that God does not exist since that is an assumption we can test Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God exists instead they generally restrict their claims so as to cover varieties of God described by followers of various religions So whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists it may be possible to prove that say a God as described by a particular religious book does not exist It may even be possible to prove that no God described by any present day religion exists In practice believing that no God described by any religion exists is very close to believing that no God exists However it is sufficiently different that counter arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of God are not really applicable But what if God is essentially non detectable If God interacts with our universe in any way the effects of his interaction must be measurable Hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable If God is essentially non detectable it must therefore be the case that he does not interact with our universe in any way Many atheists would argue that if God does not interact with our universe at all it is of no importance whether he exists or not If the Bible is to be believed God was easily detectable by the Israelites Surely he should still be detectable today Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically verifiable physical way It must surely be possible to perceive some effect caused by his presence though otherwise how can I distinguish him from all the other things that don t exist OK you may think there s a philosophical justification for atheism but isn t it still a religious belief One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is the redefinition game The cynical view of this game is as follows Person A begins by making a contentious statement When person B points out that it can t be true person A gradually re defines the words he used in the statement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept He then records the statement along with the fact that person B has agreed to it and continues Eventually A uses the statement as an agreed fact but uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure redefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it Rather than be seen to be apparently inconsistent B will tend to play along The point of this digression is that the answer to the question Isn t atheism a religious belief depends crucially upon what is meant by religious Religion is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power especially in some sort of God and by faith and worship It s worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not religion according to such a definition Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful sense Widening the definition of religious to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as religious as well such as science politics and watching TV OK so it s not a religion But surely belief in atheism or science is still just an act of faith like religion is Firstly it s not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one actually believes in Secondly it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience Most atheists try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible and even those are subject to questioning if experience throws them into doubt Science has a number of core assumptions For example it is generally assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers These are the sort of core assumptions atheists make If such basic ideas are called acts of faith then almost everything we know must be said to be based on acts of faith and the term loses its meaning Faith is more often used to refer to complete certain belief in something According to such a definition atheism and science are certainly not acts of faith Of course individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as religious followers when claiming that something is certain This is not a general tendency however there are many atheists who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof Sceptical atheism certainly doesn t fit that definition as sceptical atheism has no beliefs Strong atheism is closer but still doesn t really match as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data or the lack of it when asserting that God does not exist If atheism is not religious surely it s anti religious It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for or against friend or enemy The truth is not so clear cut Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism in that sense it can be said to be anti religion However when religious believers speak of atheists being anti religious they usually mean that the atheists have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum Most atheists take a live and let live attitude Unless questioned they will not usually mention their atheism except perhaps to close friends Of course this may be in part because atheism is not socially acceptable in many countries A few atheists are quite anti religious and may even try to convert others when possible Historically such anti religious atheists have made little impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries To digress slightly the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation of church and state just like the USA Soviet citizens were legally free to worship as they wished The institution of state atheism came about when Stalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in order to gain complete power over the population Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs but only where they see religion encroaching on matters which are not its business for example the government of the USA Such individuals are usually concerned that church and state should remain separate But if you don t allow religion to have a say in the running of the state surely that s the same as state atheism The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall not legislate concerning matters of religious belief In particular it means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of another but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in nature Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters For example religious believers have historically been responsible for encouraging many political reforms Even today many organizations campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as religious campaigns So long as they campaign concerning secular matters and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds most atheists are quite happy to see them have their say What about prayer in schools If there s no God why do you care if people pray Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers and tend to do things that those who don t pray can t just ignore Also Christian prayer in schools is intimidating to non Christians even if they are told that they need not join in The diversity of religious and non religious belief means that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event Also non prayers tend to have friends and family who pray It is reasonable to care about friends and family wasting their time even without other motives You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid What about atheists Why aren t there any atheist charities or hospitals Don t atheists object to the religious charities There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can contribute to Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well for the sake of the practical good they do Some atheists even do voluntary work for charities founded on a theistic basis Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn t worth shouting about in connection with charity To them atheism is just a simple obvious everyday matter and so is charity Many feel that it s somewhat cheap not to say self righteous to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious beliefs To weak atheists building a hospital to say I do not believe in God is a rather strange idea it s rather like holding a party to say Today is not my birthday Why the fuss Atheism is rarely evangelical You said atheism isn t anti religious But is it perhaps a backlash against one s upbringing a way of rebelling Perhaps it is for some But many people have parents who do not attempt to force any religious or atheist ideas upon them and many of those people choose to call themselves atheists It s also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing as a way of being different On the other hand many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the expectations of others On the whole we can t conclude much about whether atheism or religion are backlash or conformism although in general people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently How do atheists differ from religious people They don t believe in God That s all there is to it Atheists may listen to heavy metal backwards even or they may prefer a Verdi Requiem even if they know the words They may wear Hawaiian shirts they may dress all in black they may even wear orange robes Many Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God Some atheists even carry a copy of the Bible around for arguing against of course Whoever you are the chances are you have met several atheists without realising it Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance Unexceptional But aren t atheists less moral than religious people That depends If you define morality as obedience to God then of course atheists are less moral as they don t obey any God But usually when one talks of morality one talks of what is acceptable right and unacceptable wrong behaviour within society Humans are social animals and to be maximally successful they must co operate with each other This is a good enough reason to discourage most atheists from anti social or immoral behaviour purely for the purposes of self preservation Many atheists behave in a moral or compassionate way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans So why do they care what happens to others They don t know they simply are that way Naturally there are some people who behave immorally and try to use atheism to justify their actions However there are equally many people who behave immorally and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their actions For example Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me Jesus Christ might display His unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life Now to the king eternal immortal invisible the only God be honor and glory forever and ever The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992 by Jeffrey Dahmer the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee Wisconsin It seems that for every atheist mass murderer there is a religious mass murderer But what of more trivial morality A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior deteriorated after born again experiences While only 4 of respondents said they had driven intoxicated before being born again 12 had done so after conversion Similarly 5 had used illegal drugs before conversion 9 after Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex before salvation 5 after Freethought Today September 1991 p 12 So it seems that at best religion does not have a monopoly on moral behaviour Is there such a thing as atheist morality If you mean Is there such a thing as morality for atheists then the answer is yes as explained above Many atheists have ideas about morality which are at least as strong as those held by religious people If you mean Does atheism have a characteristic moral code then the answer is no Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person will behave Most atheists follow many of the same moral rules as theists but for different reasons Atheists view morality as something created by humans according to the way humans feel the world ought to work rather than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being Then aren t atheists just theists who are denying God A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90 of the atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for them They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around them Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial they are unbelievers through choice The vast majority of them have spent time studying one or more religions sometimes in very great depth They have made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs This decision may of course be an inevitable consequence of that individual s personality For a naturally sceptical person the choice of atheism is often the only one that makes sense and hence the only choice that person can honestly make But don t atheists want to believe in God Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them Many of them have no desire to be watched over no matter how good natured the Big Brother figure might be Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God but so what Should one believe things merely because one wants them to be true The risks of such an approach should be obvious Atheists often decide that wanting to believe something is not enough there must be evidence for the belief But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God they are unwilling in their souls to see Many if not most atheists were previously religious As has been explained above the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God exists Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God Of course it is true that some atheists lack an open mind but assuming that all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed minded Comments such as Of course God is there you just aren t looking properly are likely to be viewed as patronizing Certainly if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are being sincere if they say that they have searched for God If you are not willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth debate is futile Isn t the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist Many atheists live a purposeful life They decide what they think gives meaning to life and they pursue those goals They try to make their lives count not by wishing for eternal life but by having an influence on other people who will live on For example an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform in the hope of leaving his mark on history It is a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in random events However it is by no means obvious that life is the sort of thing that has a meaning To put it another way not everything which looks like a question is actually a sensible thing to ask Some atheists believe that asking What is the meaning of life is as silly as asking What is the meaning of a cup of coffee They believe that life has no purpose or meaning it just is So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger There are many ways of obtaining comfort from family friends or even pets Or on a less spiritual level from food or drink or TV That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger but so what Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be In the end it s a decision for the individual concerned Most atheists are unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it makes them feel comfortable They put truth before comfort and consider that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy that s just hard luck Don t atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong The short answer is No do you Many atheists have been atheists for years They have encountered many arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive Thousands of years of religious belief haven t resulted in any good proof of the existence of God Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely to be proved wrong in the immediate future and they stop worrying about it So why should theists question their beliefs Don t the same arguments apply No because the beliefs being questioned are not similar Weak atheism is the sceptical default position to take it asserts nothing Strong atheism is a negative belief Theism is a very strong positive belief Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs because of the very real harm they can cause not just to the believers but to everyone else What sort of harm Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind It s not just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings think of all the time and effort spent building churches praying and so on Imagine how that effort could be better spent Many theists believe in miracle healing There have been plenty of instances of ill people being healed by a priest ceasing to take the medicines prescribed to them by doctors and dying as a result Some theists have died because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds It is arguable that the Catholic Church s opposition to birth control and condoms in particular is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many third world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world wide Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different religion Those weren t REAL believers They just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse What makes a real believer There are so many One True Religions it s hard to tell Look at Christianity there are many competing groups all convinced that they are the only true Christians Sometimes they even fight and kill each other How is an atheist supposed to decide who s a REAL Christian and who isn t when even the major Christian churches like the Catholic Church and the Church of England can t decide amongst themselves In the end most atheists take a pragmatic view and decide that anyone who calls himself a Christian and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his actions should be considered a Christian Maybe some of those Christians are just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends but surely if the Bible can be so readily used to support un Christian acts it can t be much of a moral code If the Bible is the word of God why couldn t he have made it less easy to misinterpret And how do you know that your beliefs aren t a perversion of what your God intended If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say so Sorry but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered others because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so we must call him a Christian Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned But since nobody has ever proved that God does not exist it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs shared by all faiths are nonsense That does not hold because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much harder to disprove than negative ones Nobody has ever proved that unicorns don t exist but that doesn t make it unlikely that they are myths It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it is to hold a positive assertion by default Of course weak atheists would argue that asserting nothing is better still Well if atheism s so great why are there so many theists Unfortunately the popularity of a belief has little to do with how correct it is or whether it works consider how many people believe in astrology graphology and other pseudo sciences Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in gods Certainly in many primitive human societies religion allows the people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand Of course there s more to religion than that In the industrialized world we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when there are perfectly adequate natural explanations Religion may have started as a means of attempting to explain the world but nowadays it serves other purposes as well But so many cultures have developed religions Surely that must say something Not really Most religions are only superficially similar for example it s worth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of concept of God in the Christian sense Of course most religions are quick to denounce competing religions so it s rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that God exists For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god there is one who does not Besides as has already been pointed out the truth of a belief is not determined by how many people believe it Also it is important to realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the same way that theists view their religious leaders A famous scientist is only human she may be an expert in some fields but when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight Many respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing Not entirely It certainly indicates that the religion in question has properties which have helped it so spread so far The theory of memetics talks of memes sets of ideas which can propagate themselves between human minds by analogy with genes Some atheists view religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others Some memes avoid destruction by discouraging believers from questioning doctrine or by using peer pressure to keep one time believers from admitting that they were mistaken Some religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by other memes Of course in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a meme Religion is not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it Even if religion is not entirely true at least it puts across important messages What are the fundamental messages of atheism There are many important ideas atheists promote The following are just a few of them don t be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some religions There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules Be especially sceptical of positive claims If you want your life to have some sort of meaning it s up to you to find it Search for what is true even if it makes you uncomfortable Make the most of your life as it s probably the only one you ll have It s no good relying on some external power to change you you must change yourself Just because something s popular doesn t mean it s good If you must assume something assume something it s easy to test Don t believe things just because you want them to be true and finally and most importantly All beliefs should be open to question Thanks for taking the time to read this

intended to be exhaustive or definitive The purpose of the periodic FAQ postings is not to stifle debate but to raise its level If you have something to say concerning one of these questions and which isn t covered by the answer given please feel free to make your point Overview of contents What is the purpose of this newsgroup Hitler was an atheist The Bible proves it Pascal s Wager What is Occam s Razor Why it s good to believe in Jesus Why I know that God exists Einstein and God does not play dice Everyone worships something Why there must be a causeless cause The universe is so complex it must have been designed Independent evidence that the Bible is true Godel s Incompleteness Theorem George Bush on atheism and patriotism I know where hell is Biblical contradictions wanted The USA is a Christian nation The USA is not a Christian nation Subject What is the purpose of this newsgroup Typical posting Why have a newsgroup about atheism Why do atheists organize in groups What is there to discuss Response Many things are discussed here including Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one s family Prayer in schools Discrimination against atheists Sunday trading laws The Satanic Child Abuse myth Whether one should be an overt atheist or stay in the closet How religious societies prey sic on new college students How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers Whether religion is a danger to society and or the individual Why people become atheists Of course inevitably alt atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians looking for someone to convert Most readers of the newsgroup don t want to be preached to although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure from tearing apart particularly ill considered or uninformed postings Subject Hitler was an atheist Typical posting Hitler was an atheist and look at what he did Response Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist As he said himself The folkish minded man in particular has the sacred duty each in his own denomination of making _people_stop_just_talking_ superficially_of_God s_will _and_actually_fulfill_God s_will _and_ not_let_God s_word_be_desecrated _ orig ital For God s will gave men their form their essence and their abilities Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the Lord s creation the divine will Therefore let every man be active each in his own denomination if you please and let every man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his religious community and tries to butt into the other Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew _I_am_ fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord _ orig ital Adolf Hitler from Mein Kampf trans Ralph Mannheim Of course someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong It s also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed to believe in God We certainly can t conclude that he s an atheist though Subject The Bible proves it Typical posting In the Bible it says that Response Most of the readers of alt atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable accuracy as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years before Thus any claimed truth in it is of questionable legitimacy This isn t to say that The Bible has no truth in it simply that any truth must be examined before being accepted Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to interpretation any claim that a passage means one thing and one thing only is not legitimate Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion Subject Pascal s Wager Typical posting If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect you have lost nothing but if you don t believe in God and turn out to be incorrect you will go to hell Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist Response This argument is known as Pascal s Wager It has several flaws Firstly it does not indicate which religion to follow Indeed there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there This is often described as the avoiding the wrong hell problem If a person is a follower of religion X he may end up in religion Y s version of hell Secondly the statement that If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect you have lost nothing is not true Suppose you re believing in the wrong God the true God might punish you for your foolishness Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that the two possibilities are equally likely or at least that they are of comparable likelihood If in fact the possibility of there being a God is close to zero the argument becomes much less persuasive So sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already Also many feel that for intellectually honest people belief is based on evidence with some amount of intuition It is not a matter of will or cost benefit analysis Formally speaking the argument consists of four statements 1 One does not know whether God exists 2 Not believing in God is bad for one s eternal soul if God does exist 3 Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist 4 Therefore it is in one s interest to believe in God There are two approaches to the argument The first is to view 1 as an assumption and 2 as a consequence of it One problem with this approach in the abstract is that it creates information from no information This is considered invalid in information theory Statement 1 indicates one has no information about God but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God This violates information entropy information has been extracted from no information at no cost The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions The problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the Christian position and only a Christian will agree with that assumption The argument thus collapses to If you are a Christian it is in your interests to believe in God a rather vacuous tautology and not the way Pascal intended the argument to be viewed The biggest reason why Pascal s wager is a failure is that if God is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a wager He will spurn the latter assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him Subject What is Occam s Razor Typical posting People keep talking about Occam s Razor What is it Response William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam s Razor In its original form it said Do not multiply entities unnecessarily That is if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity then do so Nowadays when people refer to Occam s Razor they generally express it more generally for example as Take the simplest solution The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations for what we see around us 1 There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there which came into being as a result of natural processes 2 There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there and there is also a God who created the universe Clearly this God must be of non zero complexity Given that both explanations fit the facts Occam s Razor might suggest that we should take the simpler of the two solution number one Unfortunately some argue that there is a third even more simple solution 3 There isn t an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there We just imagine that there is This third option leads us logically towards solipsism which many people find unacceptable Subject Why it s good to believe in Jesus Typical posting I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion Response Preaching is not appreciated Feel free to talk about your religion but please do not write postings that are on a conversion theme Such postings do not belong on alt atheism and will be rejected from alt atheism moderated try the newsgroup talk religion misc You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you please do unto others as you would have them do unto you Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy analogies or parables Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the basic claims about him if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that God exists and brings salvation you may as well not post it since it tells us nothing we have not been told before Subject Why I know that God exists Typical posting I know from personal experience and prayer that God exists Response Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not exist That evidence varies from person to person Furthermore without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things that they have been abducted by UFOs visited by the ghost of Elvis and so on Subject Einstein and God does not play dice Typical posting Albert Einstein believed in God Do you think you re cleverer than him Response Einstein did once comment that God does not play dice with the universe This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the Christian God Used this way it is out of context it refers to Einstein s refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory Furthermore Einstein s religious background was Jewish rather than Christian A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following I believe in Spinoza s God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an objective orderly reality a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the observer He believed that QM was incomplete and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretations So far no such better theory has been found and much evidence suggests that it never will be A longer quote from Einstein appears in Science Philosophy and Religion A Symposium published by the Conference on Science Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life Inc New York 1941 In it he says The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature For him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an independent cause of natural events To be sure the doctrine of a personal God interfering with natural events could never be refuted italics his in the real sense by science for this doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge has not yet been able to set foot But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal For a doctrine which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark will of necessity lose its effect on mankind with incalculable harm to human progress In their struggle for the ethical good teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God that is give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests In their labors they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good the True and the Beautiful in humanity itself This is to be sure a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy task Einstein has also said It was of course a lie what you read about my religous convictions a lie which is being systematically repeated I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it The latter quote is from Albert Einstein The Human Side edited by Helen Dukas and Banesh Hoffman and published by Princeton University Press Also from the same book I do not believe in immortality of the individual and I consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it Of course the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does not in itself imply that Christianity is false Subject Everyone worships something Typical posting Everyone worships something whether it s money power or God Response If that is true everyone is a polytheist Theists care just as much about those things that atheists care about If the atheists reactions to for example their families amount to worship then so do the theists Subject Why there must be a causeless cause Typical posting Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member so chains of causes must all have a first element a causeless cause Response The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound but has no smallest member Further even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular religion Subject The universe is so complex it must have been designed Typical posting The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God Surely you don t think all this appeared here just by chance Response This is known as the Argument From Design It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talk origins for a while There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here However the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so called Scientific Creationism Furthermore there is much evidence observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as say a human is so improbable that surely it can t have come about by chance that surely there must be some external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately But if human intelligence is so improbable surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely The approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist position This leads us to the familiar theme of If a creator created the universe what created the creator but with the addition of spiralling improbability The only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just is or was From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just is without introducing a creator Indeed Stephen Hawking in his book A Brief History of Time explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent with no beginning or end The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy in the so called Watchmaker Argument One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker or that it evolved naturally Of course one assumes a watchmaker Yet like the watch the universe is intricate and complex so the argument goes the universe too must have a creator The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws over and above those common to all Arguments By Design Firstly a watchmaker creates watches from pre existing materials whereas God is claimed to have created the universe from nothing These two sorts of creation are clearly fundamentally different and the analogy is therefore rather weak Secondly a watchmaker makes watches but there are many other things in the world If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear reactor we wouldn t assume it was created by the watchmaker The argument would therefore suggest a multitude of creators each responsible for a different part of creation Finally in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered and therefore stands out from the randomness of nature Yet in the second part of the argument we start from the position that the universe is obviously not random but shows elements of order The Watchmaker argument is thus internally inconsistent Subject Independent evidence that the Bible is true Typical posting The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence For example Response The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary evidence Early versions of Josephus s work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or James the extant version discusses John in a non Christian context Many scholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing but that this was expanded by Christian copyists Several reconstructions of the original text have been published to this effect Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius about 320 C E It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity It is Eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this material Aside from the New Testament the biographical information about Jesus is more well documented For further information please consult the Frequently Asked Questions file for the newsgroup soc religion christian Subject Godel s Incompleteness Theorem Typical posting Godel s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the Bible to be both true and complete Response Godel s First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary arithmetic one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be valid or invalid true or false within that formal system Technically speaking the system must also be recursive that is there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal system Essentially all such systems can formulate what is known as a Liar Paradox The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is This sentence is false Note that if a proposition is undecidable the formal system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined so claims that Godel s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove the existence of God are worthless in isolation One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of God simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof however It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree with It may then be possible to show that Godel s Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system However that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists within the system Furthermore it certainly wouldn t tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of God the formal systems are just abstractions Another frequent claim is that Godel s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that a religious text the Bible the Book of Mormon or whatever cannot be both consistent and universally applicable Religious texts are not formal systems so such claims are nonsense Subject George Bush on atheism and patriotism Typical posting Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens Response The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush on August 27 1988 Sherman is a fully accredited reporter and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for Illinois The discussion turned to the presidential primary RS What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists GB I guess I m pretty weak in the atheist community Faith in God is important to me RS Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of Americans who are atheists GB No I don t know that atheists should be considered as citizens nor should they be considered patriots This is one nation under God RS Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation of state and church GB Yes I support the separation of church and state I m just not very high on atheists UPI reported on May 8 1989 that various atheist organizations were still angry over the remarks The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27 1989 It can also be found in Free Enquiry magazine Fall 1988 issue Volume 8 Number 4 page 16 On October 29 1988 Mr Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane cochairman of the Bush Quayle 88 Illinois campaign This concerned a lawsuit Mr Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School District 21 Chicago Illinois from forcing his first grade Atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as one nation under God Bush s phrase The following conversation took place RS American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing EM It s bullshit RS What is bullshit EM Everything that American Atheists does Rob is bullshit RS Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush campaign is on this issue EM You re welcome After Bush s election American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract his statement On February 21st 1989 C Boyden Gray Counsel to the President replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by his original statement and wrote As you are aware the President is a religious man who neither supports atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or supported by the government For further information

towns called Hell in various countries around the world including Norway and the USA Whilst this information is mildly amusing the first time one hears it readers of alt atheism are now getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week Subject Biblical contradictions wanted Typical posting Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions Response American Atheist Press publish an atheist s handbook detailing Biblical contradictions See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for details There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the See the contacts file for more information Subject The USA is a Christian nation Typical posting Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers shouldn t the United States be considered a Christian nation Response Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers it is clear that they never intended the US to be a Christian nation Here are some quotes there are many more What influence in fact have ecclesiastical establishments had on society In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of the civil authority on many instances they have been seen upholding the thrones of political tyranny in no instance have they been the guardians of the liberties of the people Rulers who wish to subvert the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient auxiliaries A just government instituted to secure and perpetuate it needs them not James Madison A Memorial and Remonstrance 1785 I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved the Cross Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced John Adams in a letter to Thomas Jefferson History I believe furnishes no example of a priest ridden people maintaining a free civil government This marks the lowest grade of ignorance of which their political as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own purpose Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt 1813 I cannot conceive otherwise than that He the Infinite Father expects or requires no worship or praise from us but that He is even infinitely above it Benjamin Franklin from Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion Nov 20 1728 Subject The USA is not a Christian nation Typical posting Is it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any sense founded upon the Christian religion Response No The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli 8 Stat 154 Treaty Series 358 Article 11 As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws religion or tranquility of Musselmen and as the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mehomitan nation it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections such as Charles Bevans Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America 1776 1949 vol 11 pp 1070 1080 The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U S Senate on June 7 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10 1797 It was recently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation it lacks Article XI altogether The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow Consul General at Algiers a close friend of Thomas Paine and an opponent of Christianity It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI but since there is no Arabic version of that article to be found it s hard to say In 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the quotation End of FAQ Digest ÿ']"

Candida Albicans what is it Organization Netcom Online Communications Services 408 241 9760 login guest Lines 81 In article David Rind writes In article David Partain writes Someone I know has recently been diagnosed as having Candida Albicans a disease about which I can find no information Apparently it has something to do with the body s production of yeast while at the same time being highly allergic to yeast Can anyone out there tell me any more about it Candida albicans can cause severe life threatening infections usually in people who are otherwise quite ill This is not however the sort of illness that you are probably discussing Systemic yeast syndrome where the body is allergic to yeast is considered a quack diagnosis by mainstream medicine There is a book The Yeast Connection which talks about this illness There is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists There s a lot of evidence it just hasn t been adequately gathered and published in a way that will convince the die hard melancholic skeptics who quiver everytime the word anecdote or empirical is used For example Dr Ivker who wrote the book Sinus Survival always gives before any other treatment a systemic anti fungal such as Nizoral to his new patients IF they ve been on braod spectrum anti biotics 4 or more times in the last two years He s kept a record of the results and for over 2000 patients found that over 90 of his patients get significant relief of allergic sinus symptoms Of course this is only the beginning for his program In my case as I reported a few weeks ago I was developing the classic symptoms outlined in The Yeast Connection I agree it is a poorly written book e g extreme sensitivity to plastics vapors etc which I never had before started in November Within one week of full dosage of Sporanox the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared I can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes I m also greatly improved in other areas as well Of course I have allergy symptoms etc I am especially allergic to molds yeasts etc It doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have a natural allergy to yeasts that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible symptoms Also yeast do produce toxins of various sorts and again you don t have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some people In my case it was sinus since that s the center of my allergic response Of course the 60 000 question is whether a person who is immune compromised as tests showed I was from over 5 years of antibiotics nutritionally deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies etc can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the body It is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy One almost has to take an empirical approach to diagnosis Fortunately Sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti fungals still have to be careful however so there s no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons BTW some would say to try Nystatin Unfortunately most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect You ll find a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time In summary I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right road But methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who haven t been in the trenches long enough actually treating patients If anybody doctors included said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the yeast connection I cannot guarantee their safety For their incompetence ripping off their lips is

Candida yeast Bloom Fact or Fiction Lines 187 Nntp Posting Host vms ocom okstate edu Organization OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine I can not believe the way this thread on candida yeast has progressed Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci Med Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did not exist Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well Let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with it s environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics These are the physicians who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go from doctor to doctor to find relief like Elaine in Sci Med Nutrition and then when they find one that solves their problem the rest start yelling quack Could it just be professional jealousy I couldn t help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did Could they know more than Me No way they must be a quack I ve been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten years now and guess who the most receptive students are Those that were raised on farms and saw first hand the effect of diet on the health of their farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to entering medical school switched to the vegan diet Typically this is about 1 3 of my class of 90 students Those not interested in nutrition either tune me out or just stop coming to class That s okay because I know that some of what I m teaching is going to stick and there will be at least a few enlightened physicians practicing in the U S It s really too bad that most U S medical schools don t cover nutrition because if they did candida would not be viewed as a non disease by so many in the medical profession In animal husbandry an animal is reinnoculated with good bacteria after antibiotics are stopped Medicine has decided that since humans do not have a ruminant stomach no such reinnoculation with good bacteria is needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic Humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the GI system mouth stomach small and large intestine sinuses vagina and on the skin These are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised They are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body But any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier Steve got real upset with Elaine s doctor because he was using anti fungals and vitamin A for her GI problems If Steve really understoood what vitamin A does in the body he would not or at least should not be calling Elaine s doctor a quack Here is a brief primer on yeast Yeast infections as they are commonly called are not truely caused by yeasts The most common organism responsible for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a yeast like fungus An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because like an E Coli infection it requires that the host immune system be severly depressed Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level diabetes or an oral course of antibiotics has been used In diabetics their secretions contain much higher amounts of glucose Candida unlike bacteria is very limited in it s food fuel selection Without glucose it can not grow it just barely survives If it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses GI tract or vagina In diabetics skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little buggers The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site Whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isn t certain When the bloom is in the vagina or on the skin it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to treat it If it s internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondiscript Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses the GI tract mouth stomach and intestines and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food The human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these nonpathogenic organisms unless they broach the mucus membrane barrier If they do an inflammatory response will be set up Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A from their diets About 30 of all American s die with less Vitamin A than they were born with U S autopsy studies While this low level of vitamin A does not cause pathology blindness it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom While diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned While drugs are available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection The toxicity of the anti fungal drugs does warrant some caution But if the GI or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun then anti fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections in spite of what Mr Steve Dyer says But even in patients being given the anti fungals the irritation caused by the excessive candida bloom in the sinus GI tract or the vagina tends to return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of the problem is addressed lack of a good bacterial flora in the body and or poor mucus membrane barrier Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective therapy for candida overgrowth From it s name it is an acid loving organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows Candida can not grow very well in an acidic environment In the vagina L acidophilius is the predominate bacteria unless you are hit with broad spectrum antibiotics In the GI system the ano rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer through moisture and humidity of candida to the vaginal tract One of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear If the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids If the bloom manages to move further up the GI tract very diffuse symptomatology occurs abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool This positive stool for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first place After extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt On to another doctor and so on Richard Kaplan has told me throiugh e mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives candida blooms guys If my gut hurt me on a constant basis I would want it fixed Yes it s nice to know that I don t have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress When I finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me 90 better Steve Dyer calls him a quack Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment The vagina becomes alkaline during a woman s period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal problems Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract I would want to be sure of the purity of the product before trying this My wife had this vagina problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting scripts for anti fungal creams This was a woman gynocologist who had had the same problem recurring vaginal yeast infections This M D did some digging and came up with an acetic acid and L Acidophilis douche which she used in your office to keep it sterile After three treatments sex returned to our marraige I have often wondered what an M D with chronic GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non existent syndrome The nonpathogenic bacteria L acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women If taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut Through aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes But before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened This is accomplished by vitamin A vitamin C and some of the B complex vitamins Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans are not getting enough B6 and folate These are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non existent disorder candida blooms after antibiotic therapy Some of the above material was obtained from Natural Healing by Mark Bricklin Published by Rodale press as well as notes from my human nutrition course I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A sometime in the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida blooms Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the GI system is involved If candida can not get glucose it s not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gut If Steve and some of the other nay sayers want to jump all over this post fine I jumped all over Steve in Sci Med Nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor s use of vitamin A and anti fungals for a candida bloom in her gut

his typical reserve and attacked a woman poster for being treated by a licenced physician for a disease that did not exist Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well They are just responding in their natural way Hyper Choleric Syndrome HCS Oops that is not a recognized illness in the psychological community better not say that since it therefore must not and never will exist Actually it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians will type out as NT for those not familiar with the Myers Briggs system just e mail me and I ll send a summary file to you In the general population NT s comprise only about 12 of the population but among physicians it is much much higher I don t know the exact percentage any help here a p p er s One driving characteristic of an NT especially an NTJ is their obvious choleric behavior driver type A etc the extreme emotional need to control to lead and or to be the best or the most competent If they are also extroverted they are best described as Field Marshalls This trait is very valuable and essential in our society we need people who want to lead to strive to overcome the elements to seek and thirst for knowledge to raise the level of competency etc The great successes in science and technology are in large part due to the vision an N trait and scientifically minded approach T trait of the NT personality of course the other types and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well However when the NT person has self image challenges the dark side of this personality type usually comes out which should be obvious to all A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their temperament will be extremely business like lack of empathy or feeling and is very compelled to have total control over their patient the patient must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question I ve known many M D s of this temperament and suffice to say I don t oblige them with a followup visit no matter how competent I think they are and they usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an extreme drive of theirs to know the most to know it all Maybe we need more NF doctor s Enough on this subject let s move on to candida bloom Let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with it s environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics Could it just be professional jealousy I couldn t help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did You ve helped me already by your post Of course I believe that I have been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from anal retentivitis but being the phlegmatic I am maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people myself in past posts Let s all try to raise the level of this discussion above the level of anal effluent Humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the GI system mouth stomach small and large intestine sinuses vagina and on the skin These are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised They are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body But any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier In my well described situation in prior posts I definitely was immune stressed Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low My sinuses were a mess no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years In the end even two weeks of Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuses via cat scans mucus color won t get into the details and other symptoms Three very traditional ENT s made this diagnosis I did not have any cultures done however because of the difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed a bacterial infection Enough of this background provided to help you understand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti fungal therapy below The first question I have is this Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor mucus membrane tissue maybe via hyphae thus causing symptoms without being considered systemic in the classic sense It is sort of an inbetween infection Steve got real upset with Elaine s doctor because he was using anti fungals and vitamin A for her GI problems If Steve really understoood what vitamin A does in the body he would not or at least should not be calling Elaine s doctor a quack I was concerned too because of the toxicity of vitamin A My doctor after my blood tests put me on 75 000 IU of vitamin A for one week only then dropped it down to 25 000 IU for the next couple of weeks I also received zinc and other supplementation since all of these interrelate in fairly complex ways as my doctor explained he s one of those evil orthomolecular specialists I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal he then stopped me on all vitamin A except for some in a multi vitamin supplement and made sure that I maintain a 50 000 IU day of beta carotene Call me carrot face Hopefully Elaine s doctor will take a similar careful approach and to all supplements I m even reevaluating some supplements I m taking for example niacin in fairly large dosages 1 gram day which Steve Dyer had good information about on sci med nutrition If niacin only has second order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies then it probably is not worth taking such a large dose long term and risking liver damage survives If it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses GI tract or vagina In Though I do now believe based on my successful therapy with Sporanox that I definitely had some excessive growth of fungus unknown species in my sinuses I still want to ask the question have there been any studies that demonstrate candida blooms in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation sinusitis rhinitis My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this time I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on Sporanox but some for a few days after which then went away considered normal BTW my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books sorry can t remember which one and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950 s which stated that people can develop contained non lethal or non serious aspergillis infestations aspergiliosis of the sinuses leading to sinus inflammation symptoms I ll have to dig out that reference again since it is relevant to this discussion some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site Whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isn t certain My doctor tested me I believe a RAST or RAST similar test for allergic response to specificially Candida albicans and I showed a strong positive Another question would everybody show the same strong positive so this test is essentially useless And assuming it is true that Candida can grow part way into the mucus membrane tissue and the concentration exceeds a threshold amount could not a person who tests as having an allergy to Candida definitely develop allergic symptoms such as mucus membrane irritation due to the body s allergic response As I said in an earlier post one does not need to be a rocket scientist or have a M D degree or a Ph D in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis BTW and I ll repost this again Dr Ivker in his book Sinus Survival has routinely given before anything else Nizoral a pre Sporanox systemic anti fungal not as safe and not as good as Sporanox to his new chronic sinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in the last two years He claims that out of 2000 or so patients well over 90 notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms but it doesn t cure it by any means implying the so called yeast fungus infection is not the primary cause but a later complication He s also found that nystatin whether taken internally or put into a sinus spray does not help This implies of course assuming that excessive yeast fungus bloom is aggravating the sinus inflammation that the yeast fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast fungus other than by direct contact it is not absorbed into the blood stream Again I admit lots of ifs and implies which doesn t please the hard core NT who has to have the double blind study or it s a non issue but one has to start with some plausible hypothesis explanation a strawman if you will If it s internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondescript This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny and reject any and all aspects of the yeast hypothesis until the appropriate studies are done And that is if you can t observe or culture the yeast bloom in the gut or sinus then there s no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease And I know they realize that it is virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body It s a real Catch 22 Another Catch 22 Those who totally reject the yeast hypothesis say that no studies have been done actually studies have been done but if it s not up to a certain standard then it is from their perspective a non study which should not even be considered I agree that the appropriate studies should be done and that will take big to do it right However in order to convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets you literally have to give them evidence and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study needed funding That is you have to do 90 of the study before you even get funding as a scientist at a National Lab I m very aware of this for the smaller funded projects I m afraid that even if Dr Ivker and 100 other doctors got together pooled their practice s case histories and anecdotes into a compelling picture and approach the funding agencies they would get nowhere even if they were able to publish their statistical results It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have decided excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to noticeable non lethal symptoms does not exist and is not even a tenable hypothesis so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind and not only that they would also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it s a done issue excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not will not and cannot exist Period Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint Kind of reminds me of Lister Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses the GI tract mouth stomach and intestines and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food The human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these nonpathogenic organisms unless they broach the mucus membrane barrier If they do an inflammatory response will be set up Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A from their diets About 30 of all American s die with less Vitamin A than they were born with U S autopsy studies While this low level of vitamin A does not cause pathology blindness it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom Aren t there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the sinus mucus membranes and cilia While diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned While drugs are available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection The toxicity of the anti fungal drugs does warrant some caution But if the GI or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun then anti fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections in spite of what Mr Steve Dyer says Again the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast fungus species can grow hyphae roots into deep tissue similar to mold growing in bread You can continue to kill the surface such as nystatin does but you can t kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic anti fungal such as itraconazole Sporanox or some of the older ones such as Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective This is why as has been pointed out by recent studies sent to me by a doctor I ve been in e mail contact with thanks that nystatin is not effective in the long term treatment of GI tract candidiasis It s like trying to weed a garden by cutting off what s above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come out again once you walk away The 60000 question is whether a contained candida bloom can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membranes causing some types of symptoms in susceptible people e g allergy without becoming systemic in the classical sense of the word something in between strictly an excessive bloom not causing any problems and the full blown systemic infection that is potentially lethal In the GI system the ano rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer through moisture and humidity of candida to the vaginal tract One of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear Also if one is an anal retentive like I ve been diagnosed in a prior post that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth If the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids If the bloom manages to move further up the GI tract very diffuse symptomatology occurs abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool This positive stool for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first place After extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt On to another doctor and so on Richard Kaplan has told me throiugh e mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives candida blooms guys If my gut hurt me on a constant basis I would want it fixed Yes it s nice to know that I don t have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress When I finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me 90 better Steve Dyer calls him a quack As I ve said in private e mail there are flaws in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapies AFTER the approved proven accepted therapies don t work For example I went to three ENT s who all said that I will just have to live with my acute chronic sinusitis after the ab s failed they did mention surgery to open up the ostia but my ostia weren t plugged and it would not get to the root cause of my condition After three months of aggressive and fairly non standard therapy Sporanox body nutrient level monitoring and equalization vitamin C lentinen echinacea etc my health has vastly improved to where I was two years ago before my health greatly deteriorated Of course skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have improved anyway but that view is stretching things quite far because of the experience of the three ENT s I saw who said that I d just have to live with it I m confident I will reach what one could call a total cure The anti fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of ab s for the last four years Note for those having sinus problems may I suggest the book by Dr Ivker I mention above Be sure to get the revised edition I have often wondered what an M D with chronic GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non existent syndrome Dr Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems and his visits to several ENT s totally floored him when they said you ll just have to live with it He spent several years trying everything standard and non standard until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis He now shares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road to recovery following some parts of it His one recommendation to take a systemic anti fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of anti biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own practice I m sure if I commented to him of the hard core beliefs of the anti yeast hypothesis posters that he would have definite things to say such as it s worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases to put it mildly I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations to help the patient Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the hypothetical yeast overgrowth e g they fit some of the profiles the pro yeast people have identified should consider anti fungal therapy IF all other avenues have been exhausted Remember theory and practice are two different things you cannot have one without the other they are synergistic If a doctor does something non standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patients shouldn t you at least sit up and take notice Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works instead of why it shouldn t work I m afraid a lot of doctors have become so enamored with scientific correctness that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn to help You have to do both both have to be balanced which we don t see from some of the posters to this group There comes a point when you just have to use a little common sense and maybe an empirical approach such as trying a good systemic anti fungal such as Sporanox after having exhausted all the other avenues I was one of those who the traditional medical establishment was not able to help so I did the natural thing I went to a couple of doctor s who are somewhat outside this establishment and as a result I have found significant relief Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor without fear of being sued or having his license pulled can try experimental and unproven beyond a doubt therapies for his her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective I d like to hear a doctor tell me well I ve tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this country and since they clearly don t work for you I now have the authority to use experimental unproven techniques that seem to have helped others I can t promise anything and there are some risks You will have to sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapies and I ll have to register your case at the State Board Anyway if my ENT had suggested this to me I would ve jumped on this pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who for either altruistic reasons or for greed is practicing these alternative therapies with much risk to him her risk meaning losing their license and possibly to the patient Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free It also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the compassion of the medical community to the patient that it s doing everything it can within reason to help the patient It is the lack of such a mechanism that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies some of which seem to work like my case and others of which will never work at all true quackery I better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size If taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut Through aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes But before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened This is accomplished by vitamin A vitamin C and some of the B complex vitamins Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans are not getting enough B6 and folate These are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non existent disorder candida blooms after antibiotic therapy What dosage of B6 appears to be necessary to promote the

before who develop genuine ALS but ALS is no more common among polio survivors than among people who never had polio The cause of post polio syndrome is unknown There is little evidence that post polio patients have active polio virus or destructive immunologic response to virus antigen There is no solid evidence that patients with post polio have anything different happening to the motor unit anterior horn cells motor axons neuromuscular junctions and muscle fibers than patients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration Both groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings The reason for these acute changes in a chronic disease old polio is unknown Possibly spinal motor neurons that have reinnervated huge numbers of muscle fibers start shedding the load after several years There are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post polio syndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny deterioration The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe polio The PPS patients are much more likely to complain of pain They also tend to score higher on depression scales of neuropsychologic tests My take on this I m sure some will disagree after recovery from severe polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles tendons ligaments bones and joints that leads to inflammatory and or degenerative conditions affecting these structures The increasing pain superimposed on the chronic but unchanging weakness leads to progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL I am perhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS patient who was not limited in some way by pain I do not believe that PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than non PPS patients i e those with old polio of similar severity but without PPS complaints SLMR 2 1 E mail Jim Zisfein']"

photographs over the network for public perusal scrutiny and distribution Digital immortality The basic idea behind digital immortality is that computer networks are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near forever The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future Perhaps they ll be put in different formats perhaps only surviving on backup tapes but they ll be there and someone will dig them up If that doesn t interest you OTIS also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works a virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors Suddenly life is breathed into your work and by merit of it s stimulus it will travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons Spectators are welcome also feel free to browse the gallery and let the artists know what you think of their efforts Keep your own copies of the

then either FTP put it in the CONTRIB Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me email addresses at eof in email After the image is received it will be put into the correct directory Computer originated works are also welcome OTIS directories house two types of image files GIF and JPG GIF and JPG files require oddly enough a GIF or JPG viewer to see These viewers are available for all types of computers at most large FTP sites around Internet JPG viewers are a bit tougher to find If you can t find one but do have a GIF viewer you can obtain a JPG to GIF conversion program which will change JPG files to a standard GIF format OTIS also accepts animation files When you submit image files please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used in publications or other projects or if it is merely for people to view Also include some biographical information on yourself we ll be having info files on each contributing

those as well Conversely if you have a scanner and would like to help out please contact me and we ll arrange things If you want to submit your works by disk peachy Merely send a 3 5 disk to the above address Omaha and a SASE if you want your disk back This is good for people who don t have direct access to encoders or FTP but do have access to a scanner We accept disks in either Mac or IBM compatible format If possible please submit image files as GIF or JPG If you can t we can convert from most formats we d just rather not have to At senders request we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they can stand Even if you don t have stuff to contribute you can send a blank disk and an SASE or 2 50 for disk postage and packing to get a slab o OTIS As of 04 21 93 we re at about 18 megabytes of files and growing Email me for current archive size and directory DISTRIBUTION The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way save to convert from one image format to another In fact we encourage files to be distributed to local bulletin boards and such If you could please transport the appropriate text files along with the images It would also be nice if you d send me a note when you did post images from OTIS to your local bbs I just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is It s the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as possible If you have the time please upload a few to your favorite BBS system or even just post this info file there It would be keen of you USE If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory you ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the stipulations of the permission such as free copy of publication or full address credit You will either find this in the rm file for the image or series of images or in the Artists directory under the Artists name If permission isn t explicitly given then you ll have to contact the artist to ask for it If no info is available email me and I ll get in contact with the artist for you or give you their contact information When you DO use permitted work it s always courteous to let the artist know about it perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files NAMING IMAGES Please keep the names of your files in dos format That means keep the filename before jpg or gif to eight characters or less The way I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist plus a three or four digit code for the series of images plus the series number Thus Leonardo DeVinci s fifth mechanical drawing would be something like ldmek5 gif OR ldmek5 jpg OR ldmech5 gif ETC Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems CREATING IMAGE FILES When creating image files be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture This gives people a reference in case they d like to contact you You may also want to include a title address or other information you d like people to know HMMM That s about it for now More guidelines will be added as needed Your input is expected DISCLAIMER The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS a sumerian deity or it s followers be they pope priest or ezine administrator We do take sacrifices and donations however DISCLAIMER The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original image files The files will go to the public at large It s possible as with any form of mass media that someone could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain Unless you ve given permission for that it s illegal OTIS takes no responsibility for this In simple terms all rights revert to the author artist To leave an image on OTIS is to give permission for it to be viewed copied and distributed electronically If you don t want your images distributed all over don t upload them To leave an image on OTIS is NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or broadcast that incurs profit this includes but is not limited to magazines newsletters

com In article Mr Grinch writes In article Steve Hendricks writes Okay let me try to explain this When one votes for such a creature as a Senator or worse yet a President one votes not for specific policies but for a general package which must cover all issues for 4 or 6 years As such one s influence is highly diluted I might add that even if one were free to vote on individual regulations the vast amount of time required for considering a particular regulation combined with the very small chance of one s vote making a difference would make it unreasonable to expect the voter to make an intelligent decision with respect to specific regulations I m afraid that I ve lost the thread here I didn t suggest that all government regulations be subject to referenda So I don t follow the comments above Sorry but it strikes me that it is the only feasible approach What is not feasible is a wholesale attack on all government regulation and licensing that treats cutting hair and practicing medicine as equivalent tasks I m not sure what you mean by feasible in this case Do you mean that are impossible in priciple or merely that it would be undesirable in fact I mean that an ideology that treats all government regulation as equally undesirable and seeks to abolish all regulations is unlikely to draw support among more than a miniscule portion of the electorate Furthermore I am suggesting that such a plan is not feasible in an industrial society because the weight of litigation and or misery it would produce would effectively crush productive effort Actually the only areas of public spending above that strike me as generating substantial support among libertarians are police and defense It is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to be to a principle of non coercion the only areas of public spending that they frequently support involve hiring people with guns hmmm You say this as if it were surprising yet in fact a necessary consequence of libertarian philosophy All non coersive functions should be dealt with privately therefore it follows that the only functions remaining to the state are the coersive ones No I m not surprised I just think it s interesting that on one hand libertarians assume a limited government can be decreed yet on the other posit an entire government made up of people who carry guns I realize that many libertarians assume that such a government will be counterbalanced by a fully armed citizenry but it is worth noting that widespread civilian ownership of guns does not necessarily prevent the establishment of totalitarian government e g Iraq Perhaps you have May I suggest that you consider that revolutionaries frequently generate support by acting as protectors of geezers mothers and children Governments that ignore such people on the grounds that we don t have much to fear from them do so at their own peril Much more likely it s drunken teenagers The groups in questionare more likely to be worse off during and after a revolution than before In the unlikely event that you missed my earlier sarcasm let me say this directly The idea that such programs as Social Security or AFDC should be considered defense an idea which has been advanced in ths and other newsgroups is so absurd a lie as to be unworthy of consideration Do you seriously dispute this Yup sure do But since I also support the constitutional requirement that the government provide for the general welfare Article I section 8 I m willing to justify such programs on that basis I don t want to seem patronizing but you still seem to be laboring under the delusion that under a socialized economic system it is reasonably intelligent and honest persons like yourself who make the decisions I feel any third party added to a transaction is every bit as likely to be ignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller I don t expect you to agree with me but you explain why you feel I m wrong Well in the first place I don t support a socialized economic system I think within limits that capitalism is a fine idea But it is not the case that any third party is as likely to be ignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller There are multitudes of examples where such a statement is demonstrably false Regulation of stock market transactions that provide a reasonable basis for buyers to avoid fraud is only one

Steve Hendricks writes As noted in another thread Limiting govt the problem libertarians face is insuring that the limited government they seek does not become the tool of private interests to pursue their own agenda Believe it or not we liberals are frequently as opposed to anti competitive measures as you conservatives We don t believe however that competition will necessarily be protected by the actions of business interests in a free market After all in the example you cite it was not liberals that pressed for such regulations but good staunch conservative businessmen As Adam Smith so eloquently demonstrated the free market is not something that capitalists seek to protect when they can profit from its elimination The same point was made by Marx a point of agreement between the two theorists that should tell us something I do not want the government to become a tool of private interests Limited government cannot insure that private interests will not use this government for their own agenda Agreed But this is not a failure of libertarianism It is the fact that Utopia is not an option There is no single system where everything is perfect It is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any reasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams Just as Marxism fails to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and the state is to wither away libertarians frequently fail to show how weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human condition So it is wise to look for the best solution If you compare countries to see which ones people would rather live in which ones have less starvation hunger poverty and misery you will find that they have a more limitted government than countries with alot of poverty misery and suffering No limitted government cannot insure anything but it sure is better than the alternative big government This is a strawman argument and fails on several grounds In this case limited and big government are not defined I would point out that Lebanon Somalia and the former Yugoslavia are by some definitions nations with limited government while the US Canada and nations in Western Europe where people would rather live are often pointed out as nations with big government from a libertarian point of view The argument is not between those who want limited government and those who want unlimited government It is between those who believe government regulation in a capitalist economy serves worthwhile ends and those who believe such regulation is neither desirable on empirical

Let me try to drag this discussion back to the original issues As I ve noted before I m not necessarily disputing the benefits of eliminating anti competitive legislation with regard to auto dealers barbers etc One need not however swallow the entire libertarian agenda to accomplish this end Just because one grants the benefits of allowing anyone who wishes to cut hair to sell his her services without regulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be free to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention As some many libertarians would argue On a case by case basis the cost benefit ratio of government regulation is obviously worthwhile The libertarian agenda however does not call for this assessment It assumes that the costs of regulation of any kind always outweigh its benefits This approach avoids all sorts of difficult analysis but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic to say the least I have no objection to an analysis of medical care education national defense or local police that suggests a free market can provide a more effective efficient means of accomplishing social objectives than is provided through statist approaches

First and foremost I want to mention some common sense If it s a choice between injuring killing a dog or getting yourself injured killed there is only one rational decision Only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first Second it s useful to learn how to read a dog s body language How you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it s a game and that you re playing with him is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent Third it s useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog Dogs are social beasts and recognize a domination submission hierarchy To a dog there are two types of fellow creatures that which he dominates and that which dominate him You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class You are God you are easily angered and your anger is terrible But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance and may even on rare occasions dispense a kind word a kind word or even oh joy oh rapture unforeseen A Dog Bisquit Now how does that all relate to biking Well first it s a good idea to assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it s a game and not out of overt hostility The MSF suggestion is a very good one when you see the dog coming slow down so he determines a particular place of interception Just before you and he reach that spot punch the throttle so that when he reaches it you re already long gone Dogs take a few seconds to react to new input and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle is capable of With a hostile dog or one which you repeatedly encounter stronger measures may be necessary This is the face off First and there is very important make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory Face him off on the road not on his driveway If necessary have a large stick rolled up newspaper etc something the beast will understand is something that will hurt him Stand your ground then slowly advance Your mental attitude is that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT The larger the dog the greater your anger Dogs will pick up anger just as they can pick up fear And since you and he are not on his home territory it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he is on your territory and that you are prepared to fight to the death Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there is at least a home advantage They ll also observe that you are satisfied by that retreat gesture of submission and thus they have escaped punishment The interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great deal to them The more effective you are at communicating body language the less you actually have to do After 7 years with

Modems and UARTs X Newsreader TIN version 1 1 PL8 Organization private COHERENT system Lines 33 RYAN JEFFREY BAUCOM wrote 1 What is a 16550 UART I don t know the exact meaning of UART but I think it is something like Universal Arithmetic Receiver Transmitter Normally the older boards have a 8250 or 16450 UART on board Those chips generate an IRQ for every char they received The 16550 UART has an internal 16 byte buffer so with the right software installed it generates an IRQ every 16 chars 2 What does it do for high speed modems 3 Is it necessary for 14 4k or higher throughput If you ran dos you don t need a 16550 because dos runs only ONE task at a time and the whole cpu power could be used for the transfer But if you are running a multitasking OS such as OS 2 Unix etc windows the cpu cannot work the whole time with one task The result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts 4 Is it only for internal modems NO The only diffrence is that internal modems have the UART on board whereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port which has the UART on board If you have any experience with 9600 or higher speed modems please let me know what you think Also any particular brand name reccomended or will a cheapo clone do just a well I use a Zyxel1496B with a 16550UART under COHERENT 4 0 I m very satisfied with it but I think that

he has a 14 400 modem on a 486 50 Mhz machine I can t see it having trouble keeping up His pcplus for dos works great re What to do after the high speed modem arrives Edition 01 Apr 93 This article applies only to Windows 3 0 and 3 1 and not to NT OS 2 or DOS apps not running under Windows One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that their RS 232C serial COM performance is seriously deficient Almost everyone who purchases a high speed modem V 32bis V 32 PEP or HST discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming FAX at 9600 after upgrading the modem Overrun and retry errors abound even when the only active application is the datacomm or FAX program If the transfer completes at all it may take even longer than with the old 2400bps modem There are three reasons for the problem 1 The Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitters UARTs used in most PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single byte FIFO buffers If the operating system driver cannot read and flush each character at high interrupt rates the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and the previous one is lost DOS being a fairly single minded environment during datacomm can usually keep up Windows can t 2 Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS and interrupts often take longer to service Overruns are much more likely than under DOS As soon as you report to your PC modem vendor that you are losing data you may be advised that you need to upgrade to a 16550 More likely since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance about this issue you ll get no useful advice at all Most of the store front and mail order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve my own problem had never heard the term 16550 and many didn t even know what a UART was 3 Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs and PS 2 s do or if you can upgrade your mother COM board or add a new COM board you may STILL experience errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers don t take full advantage of the 16550 Windows 3 1 is improved in this regard over 3 0 but I still recommend a driver upgrade Applications like ProComm Win which is what I use cannot get around this problem by themselves If you have a modem CARD you may not have a problem as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART and avoid overrunning it however I wouldn t want to bet that the card designers were that clever and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem card Some modem cards don t even have conventional UARTs but if they are to work with standard Windows drivers they need to simulate one Use MSD EXE below to see what the modem card is or is pretending to be The Hardware Situation The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250 or Ns16450 chips or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can t replace them You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft diagnostic program INDOWS SD EXE Be sure to run it in DOS before bringing up Windows The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt The Ns16550 UART has separate 16 byte transmit and receive FIFOs with configurable trigger levels and can run reliably at clock rates up to 460 800 bps although with current modem technology there s no point in pushing your luck by going over 115 200 bps The 16550 has shorted access cycle times than the 16450 or 8250 The 16550 also has DMA capability but it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this For more technical info see National Semiconductor Application Note AN 491 So what UART component do you have Try to locate the UART on your mother board multi function I O card COM board or ISA MCA modem card If you can t find a socketed component with the numbers 8250 or 16450 your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI and you won t be able to perform a chip replacement If you can DISABLE your VLSI COM ports as I chose to do you can at least add an aftermarket COM board If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips you can buy plug in Ns16550AFN or PC16C550CN low power CMOS version ICs from several suppliers typically for 9 to 15 each The N chip is the normal 40 pin dual in line package Other styles are available but avoid any Ns16550 chips without the A the 16C550C are presumably all OK Early Ns chips have bugs although National will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for free Clone chips are available from various IC

IBM reportedly will upgrade them If you DON T have socketed 8250 16450 chips you ll need to buy an after market COM or multi function board If this is a modem card situation you may be hosed To add a new COM or multi function card you ll need to either disable the COM1 2 port s you are replacing or re assign them to COM3 4 although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom Although cheaper

MCT card from JDR I only needed two serial ports and am running out of IRQs on my PC so I disabled my built in VLSI based 8250 ports However with the TurboCom driver below I could have set the internals as COM3 and 4 using IRQ sharing The Software Situation Simply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun problems The standard MS serial drivers don t take full advantage of the 16550 The Windows 3 0 drivers are even less capable and the Windows 3 1 drivers have the following limitations They enable only the receive FIFO and only at rates above 2400 bps They never enable the transmit FIFO which results in an interrupt rate of 10x during uploads They set the trigger level at 14 bytes too high it s easy for 2 more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200 With a V 32bis modem sparse data and text can easily compress 3 1 or more suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57 600 bps would be effective The API won t accept rates above CBR_128000 The API won t let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there and even if it did DOS programs that aren t 16550 aware get little benefit from a 16550 port with the standard drivers They don t allow IRQ sharing for COM3 4 The BIOS doesn t initialize COM3 4 properly in many systems Windows provides no workaround for apps that don t provide port speed options above 19200 bps These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6 0 and may or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3 1 but before 4 0 Rumors suggest they may be solved in Windows 4 0 You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of TurboCom current version 1 2 from Bio Engineering Research Pacific

set up to accept credit cards so I had to send a check Egghead and 1 800 Software list TurboCom but as far as I know they don t stock it Bio is not a software company per se They apparently needed reliable hi speed serial connections for an in house instrument application wrote their own driver discovered a market for it revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite They recently upgraded it for Windows 3 1 It is run time licensed I now have my host DTE connect rate set to 57 600 bps most of my datacomm apps and I am having ZERO problems with downloads I routinely see transfer rates that exceed 2 000 bps I am also using 115 200 bps when linking an HP95LX to my PC with lossless bi directional I O Uploads to various remote systems are another matter because many hosts are still using antique UARTs and drivers Note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3 1 Port menu in Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port TurboCom gets around this by allowing you to specify on each port a factor that will set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the Windows APIs and dialog boxes I also have CTS RTS hardware flow control enabled and I suggest that you do the same Even if you only ever transfer 7 bit ASCII data Xon XOff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control The informal DEC standard for Xon Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another 16 yes sixteen bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving system or device The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on Xon Xoff A well respected datacomm engineer has informed me that the 16550 s can t really do CTS RTS all by itself in the DOS Windows environment so using data rates above 115 200 may still be risky Even with hardware flow control a 16550 with TurboCom can still experience overruns in very busy systems with lots of apps running and serious swapping in progress If this is your situation you may need to buy a co processed COM board but this will cost you more than a 16550 TurboCom upgrade A review of two such boards and a review of TurboCom can be found in the Feb 93 issue of Windows Sources magazine I suggest trying a 16550 TurboCom upgrade first and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a power user whose thrashing system still runs into comm problems Closing Soapbox Comments The state of RS 232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer industry Because it is the oldest standard I O interface the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer companies The design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the art In my last job with a major workstation vendor I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new system That family of machines was subsequently introduced with 16550 ports However this is the exception Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent I O You may as well learn what you can about serial I O because this situation shows no sign of improving soon When V FAST arrives I expect cries of outrage from Windows users world wide whose 8250 PCs sort of work today with V 32 but will fail miserably with V FAST Without a hardware buffered UART like the 16550 and without software drivers that use that UART to best advantage a V FAST modem will be a waste of money Regards 1001 A East Harmony Road Bob Niland Suite 503 Internet Fort

Organization University at Buffalo Lines 38 Nntp Posting Host ubvm cc buffalo edu In article Mark Robert Thorson writes I don t understand the assumption that because something is found to be carcinogenic that it would not be legal in the U S I think that No there is something called the Delany Amendment which makes carcinogenic food additives illegal in any amount This was passed by Congress in the 1950 s before stuff like mass spectrometry became available which increased detectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude This is why things like cyclamates and Red 2 were banned They are very weakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats so under the Act they are banned This also applies to natural carcinogens Some of you might remember a time back in the 1960 s when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good and never tasted so good again That was the time when safrole was banned This is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves If it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days someone would do it in order to make money The fact that no one does it indicates that enforcement is still in effect An odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as gumbo file This is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves This is not only a natural product but a natural product still in its natural form so maybe that s how they evade Delany Or maybe a special exemption was made to appease powerful Louisiana Democrats I think what we have to keep in mind is that even though it may be illegal to commercially produce sell food with carcinogenic substances it is not illegal for people to do such to their own food smoking etc Is this true', 'From Mark Robert Thorson Subject Re Barbecued foods and health risk Organization The Portal System TM Lines 72 This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw Today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot He used a strange technique I d never seen before He took a big pot with lid and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee table ash tray made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges In the tray he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar a similar quantity of brown rice he said any rice will do the contents of two teabags of Earl Grey tea and a few cloves On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket type steamer with two chicken breasts in it The lid was put on and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes Later he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts What surprises and concerns me are 1 No wood chips Where does the smoke flavor come from 2 About 5 or 10 years ago I remember hearing that carmel color obtained by caramelizing sugar a common coloring and flavoring agent had been found to be carcinogenic I believe they injected it under the skin of rats or something If the results were conclusive caramel color would not be legal in the U S yet it is still being used Was the initial research result found to be incorrect or what 3 About 5 or 10 years ago I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated as carcinogenic because it contains oil of bergamot an extract from the skin of a type of citrus fruit Does anyone know whatever happened with that story If it were carcinogenic Earl Grey tea could not have it as an additive yet it apparently continues to do so WRT natural wood smoke I ve smoking a duck right now as it happens I ve noticed that a heavily smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low molecular weight stuff like terpenes and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar The long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low molecular weight stuff just leaving the flavor behind Does anyone know if my theory is correct I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic For that reason and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess I only grill non drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals I do stuff like this duck by indirect heat I have a long rectangular Weber and I put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end The fat drops directly on the floor below the meat and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and

University of Wisconsin Academic Computing Center Distribution world Lines 88 In article Mark Robert Thorson writes This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw Today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot He used a strange technique I d never seen before He took a big pot with lid and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee table ash tray made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges In the tray he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar a similar quantity of brown rice he said any rice will do the contents of two teabags of Earl Grey tea and a few cloves On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket type steamer with two chicken breasts in it The lid was put on and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes Later he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts What surprises and concerns me are 1 No wood chips Where does the smoke flavor come from 2 About 5 or 10 years ago I remember hearing that carmel color obtained by caramelizing sugar a common coloring and flavoring agent had been found to be carcinogenic I believe they injected it under the skin of rats or something If the results were conclusive caramel color would not be legal in the U S yet it is still being used Was the initial research result found to be incorrect or what 3 About 5 or 10 years ago I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated as carcinogenic because it contains oil of bergamot an extract from the skin of a type of citrus fruit Does anyone know whatever happened with that story If it were carcinogenic Earl Grey tea could not have it as an additive yet it apparently continues to do so WRT natural wood smoke I ve smoking a duck right now as it happens I ve noticed that a heavily smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low molecular weight stuff like terpenes and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar The long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low molecular weight stuff just leaving the flavor behind Does anyone know if my theory is correct I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic For that reason and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess I only grill non drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals I do stuff like this duck by indirect heat I have a long rectangular Weber and I put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end The fat drops directly on the floor below the meat and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals And yet another reason I ve heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat like pork sausage and bacon contains nitrosamines which are carcinogenic I m pretty sure this claim actually has some standing don t know about the others An amusing incident I recall was the Duncan Hines

to 0 5 Duncans I don t understand the assumption that because something is found to be carcinogenic that it would not be legal in the U S I think that naturally occuring substances excluding controlled substances are pretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food food additives or other consumption It s only when the chemists concoct sp an ingredient that it falls under FDA regulations Otherwise if they really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything How in the world do you suppose it s legal to consume tobacco products which probably SHOULD be

of the Laws of Nature specifying cause and effect seems to dictate at least to this layman s mind there must be a causal event No reasonable alternative exists I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime causes precede their effects And I must concede here Cause before effect implies time time is part of spacetime Hense the argument would be valid I could return and say that this does not infer the cause and effect relationship being unique to this spacetime but I won t 8 because the point is moot Doesn t address why which Petri Pikho addresses below I also concede that I was doubly remiss as I asserted No reasonable alternative exists an entirely subjective statement on my part and one that could be invalidated given time and further discovery by the scientist I also understand that a proving a theory does not necessarily specify that this is how it happened but proposes a likely description of the phenomena in question Am I mistaken with this understanding But if you claim that there must be an answer to how did the universe our spacetime emerge from nothing science has some good candidates for an answer All of which require something we Christians readily admit to Faith The fact that there are several candidates belies that none are conclusive With out conclusive evidence we are left with faith It could even be argued that one of these hypotheses may one day be proven as best as a non repeatable event can be proven But I ask what holds someone today to the belief that any or all of them are correct except by faith a couple of paragraphs deleted Summary we ask Why does the universe exist I think this question should actually be split into two parts namely 1 Why is there existence Why anything exists and 2 How did the universe emerge from nothing It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question However is it a meaningful question after all I would say it isn t Consider the following Apparently it is for many persons Hence we have religions The question why anything exists can be countered by demanding answer to a question why there is nothing in nothingness or in non existence Actually both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning Things that exist do and things that don t exist don t exist Tautology at its best Carefully examine the original question and then the counter question The first asks Why while the second is a request for definition It doesn t address why something does or does not exist but asks to define the lack of existence The second question is unanswerable indeed for how do we identify something as nothing aren t they mutually exclusive terms How do we identify a state of non existence again this is nearing the limits of this simple layman s ability to comprehend and I would appreciate an explanation I might add the worldview of Things that exist do and things that don t don t is as grounded in the realm of the non falsifiable as does the theist s belief in God It is based on the assumption that there is not a reason for being something as ultimately un supportable as the position of there being a reason Its very foundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there is a reason We come to this Either I am therefore I am or I am for a reason If the former is a satisfactory answer then you are done for you are satisfied and need not a doctor If the latter your search is just beginning I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question Time will tell 8 Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually God is Himself the existence However I see several problems with this answer First it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is actually _all_ existence good and evil devils and angels us and them This is pantheism not Christianity Agreed It would lead me to question their definition of Christianity as well Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence This sounds much better but I am tempted to ask Does God Himself exist then If God is the source of His own existence it can only mean that He has in terms of human time always existed But this is not the same as the source of all existence This does not preclude His existence It only seeks to identify His qualities implying He exists to have qualities BTW The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions Being an atheist myself I do not accept such answers since I do not have any other methods Like the theist we come to a statement of faith for this position assumes that the evidence at hand is conclusive Note I am not arguing against scientific endeavor for science is useful for understanding the universe in which we exist But I differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective I seek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the Creator I also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer why It appears that M Pihko agrees as we shall see But because a tool is inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question Asserting that why is an invalid question does not provide an answer As far as I can tell the very laws of nature demand a why That isn t true of something outside of nature i e super natural This is not true Science is a collection of models telling us how not why something happens I cannot see any good reason why the why questions would be bound only to natural things assuming that the supernatural domain exists If supernatural beings exist it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist My apologies I was using why as why did this come to be Why did pre existence become existence Why did pre spacetime become spacetime But we come to the admission that science fails to answer Why Because it can t be answered in the realm of modern science does that make the question invalid I don t believe any technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life despite having all of the parts available Just my opinion This opinion is also called vitalism namely that living systems are somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems Do Christians in general adopt this position What would happen when scientists announce they have created primitive life say small bacteria in a lab I suppose we would do the same thing as when Galileo or Capernicus was vindicated before someone starts jumping up and down screaming Inquisition note I said vindicated I certainly hope we ve gotten beyond the shooting the messenger stage M Pihko does present a good point though We may need to ask What do I as an individual Christian base my faith on Will it be shaken by the production of evidence that shatters our sacred cows or will we seek to understand if a new discovery

anything exists and 2 How did the universe emerge from nothing It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question However is it a meaningful question after all I would say it isn t Consider the following A die hard skeptic being be it human or whatever attempts to doubt one s very existence Since it is so easy to doubt everything else I cannot be _sure_ the world exists it may be my mind fooling me can I ever be sure I exist However it is only possible to exist or not to exist Someone insert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here A being that does not exist cannot doubt one s existence A being that does exist can doubt one s existence but this would be pointless the being would exist anyway Let us return to the original question why A being that does not exist does not need any reasons for its non existence This being is not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind but let us assume that the world exists independent of the mind the objectivity postulate The question why anything exists can be countered by demanding answer to a question why there is nothing in nothingness or in non existence Actually both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning Things

from His meta existent perspective He created existence I think this is actually a nonsolution a mere twist of words The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions Being an atheist myself I do not accept such answers since I do not have any other methods The second question How did the universe emerge from nothing belongs to the domain of science and I for one do not doubt the question can be answered by its methods Many cosmologists have suggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge from vacuum this possibility has been suggested in a recent Hawking biography see also Lizhi Shuxian Creation of the Universe World Scientific 1989 However I think the sci groups are more appropriate for discussions like this As far as I can tell the very laws of nature demand a why That isn t true of something outside of nature i e super natural This is not true Science is a collection of models telling us how not why something happens I cannot see any good reason why the why questions would be bound only to natural things assuming that the supernatural domain exists If supernatural beings exist it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist I believe the genetic code will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining

was an excellent discussion in sci skeptic on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago I hope it did not escape your notice The correct word is likely There is no way to be sure our models and theories are absolutely correct Theories are backed up by evidence but not proved no theory can be true in a mathematical sense However theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of phenomena It is extremely important to test whether theories can _predict_ something new or not yet observed All successful theories science has come up with have passed this test including the Big Bang theory of cosmic evolution the theory of natural selection etc It does not mean they _must_ be correct but they are not mere best fits for the data But if you claim that there must be an answer to how did the universe our spacetime emerge from nothing science has some good candidates for an answer All of which require something we Christians readily admit to Faith Well yes if you want to _believe_ in them This is not what science requires take a good look at the theory and the evidence see if the theory has made any successful predictions and use your reason Disbelievers are not punished The fact that there are several candidates belies that none are conclusive With out conclusive evidence we are left with faith This is what puzzles me why do we need to have faith in

answer Imagine for a moment that the nobodies in non existence could also ask Why nothing exists This is equivalent to my counter question why nothing exists in nothingness Now why anything exists is equivalent to why something exists in somethingness _This_ is what I meant with my tautology my apologies for the poor wording in my previous post I might add the worldview of Things that exist do and

or existence in general for reasons I stated above However they will still leave open the question why this and not that and this is where theistic explanations come in Science cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human being s existence We come to this Either I am therefore I am or I am for a reason This is a deep philosophical question is determinism true or not Also is God deterministic or not I tend to think this question has no meaning in His case If I am for a reason I ve yet failed to see what it would be From our perspective it looks like I exist for truly random reasons I just rolled two dice why did I get 6 and 1 How can I believe there is any better reason for my existence If the former is a satisfactory answer then you are done for you are satisfied and need not a doctor If the latter your search is just beginning Yes I am satisfied with this reason until I find something better My 15 years of Christianity were of no help in this respect I have to admit but I am

mean that He has in terms of human time always existed But this is not the same as the source of all existence This does not preclude His existence It only seeks to identify His qualities implying He exists to have qualities BTW No it doesn t but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists for an answer to this question is not knowable Of course this should not be any obstacle to belief in His existence I also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer why It appears that M Pihko agrees as we shall see But because a tool is inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question Asserting that why is an invalid question does not provide an answer It is impossible to know unknowable things However the question why do I exist in particular is _not_ an invalid question this is not what I said But from our perspective it is impossible to tell and I can t just believe in any given explanation instead of another especially since I found I was deluding myself My apologies I was using why as why did this come to be Why did pre existence become existence Why did pre spacetime become spacetime I think pre existence is an oxymoron There is no time outside of this spacetime except in some other universe and from that perspective our universe never was It exists only for those who are inside it But we come to the admission that science fails to answer Why Because it can t be answered in the realm of modern science does that make the question invalid No The validity of the question has to be discussed separately I think philosophy is of great help here What can be known and what is not knowable M Pihko does present a good point though We may need to ask What do I as an individual Christian base my faith on Will it be shaken by the production of

you I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica GT I decided to buy myself a gift a more exotic car Front runners included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 1987 model years I narrowed it down to those two I liked the simplicity and handling and snob appeal too of driving a Porsche The Supra Turbo was less money and had more features and performance almost a personal luxury car It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924 I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924 but i decided to stop by my insurance agent s office on the way I asked about what would happen to my rate with either car If you buy the Supra your rate classification will be the same as the Celica the 85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars with a slight increase because the car will be 2 years newer Our lower risk division will continue to handle your account If you buy the Porsche 924 we ll have to change you to the standard higher rate company and your rate will double And if you go with a 944 it s another story again we ll cover the rest of this year but cancel you after that But the Supra is much faster than the 924 and the 924 is actually faster than the standard 944 That doens t make sense That s what the book says We don t insure Corvettes either For some reason the underwriters consider Supras and their drivers as very traditional and conservative I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons The Porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested but a tough high pressure guy in

two riders on identical machines It s the one who knows what he s doing and why that will be faster It may be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is through trial and error

an interesting bit of knowledge and to claim that it is essential for all bikers to know it or that you can corner faster or better as a result is absurd Do you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd Are you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management policy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or decrease available traction Braking It is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum swerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques For most of his riding life this may not be a problem but in an emergency situation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage But by including countersteering theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily right at the time when there are far more important matters for them to learn I disagree The existance and immense success of riding courses which teach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner that is neither confusing nor detracts from any other aspects of the course And that was my original point Perhaps but in the ensuing discussion you strayed far from that point to claim that knowledge of

the road Preparedness is in my opinion to know as much as possible So to exclude some aspects of riding a bike in a course is wrong IMHO Now to countersteering in particular Countersteering is something that must be trained A common reaction among new bikers or bicycle riders in an emergency situation is to steer the motorcycle like a bicycle As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the direction opposite to what was intended Needless to say this is dangerous I have a specific example A rider in a left turn The rider thinks he she is to close to the right shoulder of the road and tries to steer the motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right handle The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road A worse scenario The same rider same turn In the middle of the turn the rider sees a truck coming towards him her The panicking rider tries to steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it The main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency situations AND what to do if in one Thus the knowledge and training of countersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course', 'From Mike Sixsmith Subject Re

in 1 knowing what s happening and how to make it do it especially in the extreme case of an emergency swerve and 2 just letting the bike do whatever it does to make itself turn Once I knew precisely what was happening and how to make it do it abruptly and on command my emergency avoidance abilities improved tenfold not to mention a big improvement in my normal cornering ability I am much more proficient knowing how to countersteer the motorcycle rather than letting the motorcycle steer itself That is when I remember to take cognitive command of the bike rather than letting it run itself

along for the ride Bill you are kidding yourself here Firstly motorcycles do not steer themselves only the rider can do that Secondly it is the adhesion of the tyre on the road the suspension geometry

formal rider education with have regarded the experience as overwhelmingly positive This regardless of the amount of experience they brought into the course ranging from 10 minutes to 10 years Formal training in this country as far as I am aware does not include countersteering theory I found out about countersteering about six years ago from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist I didn t believe him at first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left but I went out and analysed closely what I was doing and realized he was right It s an interesting bit of knowledge and I ve had a lot of fun since then telling others about it who were at first as sceptical as I was But that s all it is an interesting bit of knowledge and to claim that it is essential

intently following the MAG thread while waiting for mine to arrive in the mail There seems to be a lot of complaints about minor alignment problems with the MX15F One article contained a comment that the owner called the factory and was told that his screen rotation was within spec 1 4 That figure 1 4 for image rotation would seem to be a little high on my NEC 5FG the specs call for no greater than 3mm 0 12 Well my monitor arrived last night and sure enough it has a very noticable barrel distortion It s not dramatic but it is there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn t fill the entire screen The fact that it is worse on the right side doesn t help matters What I m trying to find out is if these minor imperfections are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect I don t want to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse problem Does the factory consider this kind of thing normal and ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment I can t speak for MAG Innovision but as far as NEC is concerned they are adjusted to factory spec before leaving the central USA distribution point MA for the eastern Canadian market Now here s the key NEC knows that the 15 monitors adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over distances with all the bumps rough handling and such and therefore expect and at least in theory require that the local distributor not dealer have it adjusted at the local service centre Bull HN Information Systems in Toronto before sale This is the correct and probably only way of having any chance of receiving a perfect monitor the definition of perfect seems to depend on how picky one is in my case quite Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections I for one was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard monitor and after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor not perfect IMHO but a major improvement over what the dealer and

Nanao T560i There s no question that the Nanao monitors are the best available this year just as they were last year The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the ranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing criteria and the scoring I used different tests than they did and I scored differently There s nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi and it scored very highly in my tests but it was a few points shy of perfect Incidentally one of the things everyone should do when they re reading reviews of any product whether it s monitors or mice is to read the criteria and methodology carefully Unless you know how the product testing was done and on what the scores are based you can t possibly know what they really mean Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently from Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the ranking Likewise it s impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet your needs unless you know how we did the testing

Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe Cassini is a joint NASA ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe Cassini is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV Centaur in October of 1997 After gravity assists of Venus Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA trajectory the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004 Upon arrival the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an orbit around Saturn Near the end of this initial orbit the Huygens Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of Titan The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the surface After the completion of the Probe mission the Orbiter continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years Titan synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and targeted flybys of Iapetus Dione and Enceladus The objectives of the mission are threefold conduct detailed studies of Saturn s atmosphere rings and magnetosphere conduct close up studies of Saturn s satellites and characterize Titan s atmosphere and surface One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere These hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain down onto the surface The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to peer through Titan s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the surface Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini 1625 1712 the first director of the Paris Observatory who discovered several of Saturn s satellites and the major division in its rings The Titan atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens 1629 1695 who discovered Titan and first described the true nature of Saturn s rings Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission VVEJGA

study the Sun from an orbit over its poles Launched in late 1990 it carries particles and fields experiments such as magnetometer ion and electron collectors for various energy ranges plasma wave radio receivers etc but no camera Since no human built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of the ecliptic plane it went to Jupiter instead and stole energy from that planet by sliding over Jupiter s north pole in a gravity assist manuver in February 1992 This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted about 85 degrees to the ecliptic It will pass over the Sun s south pole in the summer of 1993 Its aphelion is 5 2 AU and surprisingly its perihelion is about 1 5 AU that s right a solar studies spacecraft that s always further from the Sun than the Earth is While in Jupiter s neigborhood

PROBES HISTORICAL MISSIONS This section was lightly adapted from an original posting by Larry Klaes mostly minor formatting changes Matthew Wiener contributed the section on Voyager and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material posted by Yoshiro Yamada US PLANETARY MISSIONS MARINER VENUS MARS MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS MARINER 1 the first U S attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus failed minutes after launch in 1962 The guidance instructions from the ground stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna so the onboard computer took control However there turned out to be a bug in the guidance software and the rocket promptly went off course so the Range Safety Officer destroyed it Although the bug is sometimes claimed to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement it was actually a transcription error in which the bar indicating smoothing was omitted from the expression R dot bar sub n nth smoothed value of derivative of radius This error led the software to treat normal minor variations of velocity as if they were serious leading to incorrect compensation MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December of 1962 and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a very hot 800 degrees Fahrenheit now revised to 900 degrees F world with a cloud covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978 MARINER 3 launched on November 5 1964 was lost when its protective shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary space Unable to collect the Sun s energy for power from its solar panels the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in solar orbit It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4 MARINER 4 the sister probe to MARINER 3 did reach Mars in 1965 and took the first close up images of the Martian surface 22 in all as it flew by the planet The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere much thinner than previously thought Many scientists concluded from this preliminary scan that Mars was a dead world in both the geological and biological sense MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967 It reconfirmed the data on that planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2 plus the information that Venus atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times that of Earth s or the equivalent of being 3 300 feet under the surface of an ocean MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work done by MARINER 4 four years earlier However they failed to take away the concept of Mars as a dead planet first made from the basic measurements of MARINER 4 MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket launcher autopilot failed MARINER 9 the sister probe to MARINER 8 became the first craft to orbit Mars in 1971 It returned information on the Red Planet that no other probe had done before revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian surface as well as giant canyon systems and evidence that water once flowed across the planet The probe also took the first detailed closeup images of Mars two small moons Phobos and Deimos MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974 The probe did return the first close up images of the Venusian atmosphere in ultraviolet revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four Earth days MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974 to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas The probe revealed Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than thought This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which makes up 75 percent of the entire planet PIONEER MOON SUN VENUS JUPITER and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective to photograph the Moon close up but they did reach far enough into space to provide new information on the area between Earth and the Moon including new data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth All three craft had failures with their rocket launchers PIONEER 1 was launched on October 11 1958 PIONEER 2 on November 8 and PIONEER 3 on December 6 PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first U S spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959 PIONEER 5 was originally designed to flyby Venus but the mission was scaled down and it instead studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to 36 2 million kilometers in 1960 a record until MARINER 2 PIONEER 6 through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968 PIONEER 6 7 and 8 are still transmitting information at this time PIONEER E would have been number 10 suffered a launch failure in 1969 PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973 PIONEER 11 followed it in 1974 and then went on to become the first probe to study Saturn in 1979 Both vehicles should continue to function through 1995 and are heading off into interstellar space the first craft ever to do so PIONEER Venus 1 1978 also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter or PIONEER 12 burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8 1992 PVO made the first radar studies of the planet s surface via probe PIONEER Venus 2 also known as PIONEER 13 sent four small probes into the atmosphere in December of 1978 The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the atmosphere while the four probes descended by parachute towards the surface Though none were expected to survive to the surface the Day probe did make it and transmitted for 67 5 minutes on the ground before its batteries failed RANGER LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series They were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961 but rocket problems left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed RANGER 3 launched on January 26 1962 was intended to land an instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon but problems during the launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by but the camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt RANGER 4 launched April 23 1962 had the same purpose as RANGER 3 but suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside the first U S probe to reach the Moon albeit without returning data RANGER 5 launched October 18 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4 lost all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon and drifted off into solar orbit RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions They were to send back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact with the Moon RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras did not operate RANGER 7 through 9 performed well becoming the first U S lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965 LUNAR ORBITER LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO missions of 1969 1972 The probes also contributed greatly to our understanding of lunar surface features particularly the lunar farside All five probes of the series launched from 1966 to 1967 were essentially successful in their missions They were the first U S probes to orbit the Moon All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions SURVEYOR LUNAR SOFT LANDERS The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the soil before this time it was feared by some that the Moon was covered in great layers of dust which would not support a heavy landing vehicle SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968 Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions The rest became the first U S probes to soft land on the Moon taking thousands of images and scooping the soil for analysis APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth SURVEYOR 7 the last of the series was a purely scientific mission which explored the Tycho crater region in 1968 VIKING MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral Florida on August 20 1975 on a TITAN 3E CENTAUR D1 rocket The probe went into Martian orbit on June 19 1976 and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse Planitia on July 20 1976 It soon began its programmed search for Martian micro organisms there is still debate as to whether the probes found life there or not and sent back incredible color panoramas of its surroundings One thing scientists learned was that Mars sky was pinkish in color not dark blue as they originally thought the sky is pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the thin atmosphere The lander set down among a field of red sand and boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7 1980 when it ran out of attitude control propellant The lander was switched into a weather reporting mode where it had been hoped it would keep functioning through 1994 but after November 13 1982 an errant command had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until further orders Communication was never regained again despite the engineers efforts through May of 1983 An interesting side note VIKING 1 s lander has been designated the Thomas A Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the lander imaging team The National Air and Space Museum in Washington D C is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition VIKING 2 was launched on September 9 1975 and arrived in Martian orbit on August 7 1976 The lander touched down on September 3 1976 in Utopia Planitia It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its sister lander with the exception that its seisometer worked recording one marsquake The orbiter had a series of attitude control gas leaks in 1978 which prompted it being shut down that July The lander was shut down on April 12 1980 The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025 VOYAGER OUTER PLANET FLYBYS VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5 1977 and flew past Jupiter on March 5 1979 and by Saturn on November 13 1980 VOYAGER 2 was launched August 20 1977 before VOYAGER 1 and flew by Jupiter on August 7 1979 by Saturn on August 26 1981 by Uranus on January 24 1986 and by Neptune on August 8 1989 VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare once every 189 years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to outer planet VOYAGER 1 could in principle have headed towards Pluto but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up Between the two probes our knowledge of the 4 giant planets their satellites and their rings has become immense VOYAGER 1 2 discovered that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics lightning and aurorae Three new satellites were discovered Two of the major surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous volcanoes with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere When the two probes reached Saturn they discovered over 1000 ringlets and 7 satellites including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep the rings stable The weather was tame compared with Jupiter massive jet streams with minimal variance a 33 year great white spot band cycle is known Titan s atmosphere was smoggy Mimas appearance was startling one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings Braids kinks and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain VOYAGER 2 thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune Uranus itself was highly monochromatic in appearance One oddity was that its magnetic axis was found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational axis giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere Icy channels were found on Ariel and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains 10 satellites and one more ring were discovered In contrast to Uranus Neptune was found to have rather active weather including numerous cloud features The ring arcs turned out to be bright patches on one ring Two other rings and 6 other satellites were discovered Neptune s magnetic axis was also skewed Triton had a canteloupe appearance and geysers What s liquid at 38K The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades Their on target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets beyond Pluto Their next major scientific discovery should be the location of the heliopause SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon Venus and Mars I

Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to human computer error PHOBOS 2 Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos The probe did enter Mars orbit in early 1989 but signals ceased one week before scheduled Phobos landing While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter Saturn and even interstellar probes within the next thirty years no major steps have yet been taken with these projects More intensive studies of the Moon Mars Venus and various comets have been planned for the 1990s and a Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been planned for 2003 How the many changes in the former Soviet Union now the Commonwealth of Independent States will affect the future of their space program remains to be seen JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS SAKIGAKE MS T5 was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on January 8 1985 and approached Halley s Comet within about 7 million km on March 11 1986 The spacecraft is carrying three instru ments to measure interplanetary magnetic field plasma waves solar wind all of which work normally now so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on January 8 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth s The closest approach was at 23h08m47s JST UTC 9h on January 8 1992 The geocentric distance was 88 997 km This is the first planet swingby for a Japanese spacecraft During the approach Sakigake observed the geotail Some geotail passages will be scheduled in some years hence The second Earth swingby will be on June 14 1993 at 40 Re Earth s radius and the third October 28 1994 at 86 Re HITEN a small lunar probe was launched into Earth orbit on January 24 1990 The spacecraft was then known as MUSES A but was renamed to Hiten once in orbit The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first lunary flyby on March 19 where it dropped off its 26 lb midget satellite HAGOROMO Japan at this point became the third nation to orbit a satellite around the Moon joining the Unites States and USSR The smaller spacecraft Hagoromo remained in orbit around the Moon An apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists to lose track of it Hagoromo s rocket motor fired on schedule on March 19 but the spacecraft s tracking transmitter failed immediately The rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt camera 105 cm F3 1 at the Kiso Observatory in Japan Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth s atmosphere Hiten made a close approach to the moon at 22 33 JST UTC 9h on February 15 1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon s surface 35 3N 9 7E and fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into lunar orbit The following is the orbital calculation results after the approach Apoapsis Altitude about 49 400 km Periapsis Altitude about 9 600 km Inclination 34 7 deg to ecliptic plane Period 4 7 days PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES I also recommend reading the following works categorized in three groups General overviews specific books on particular space missions and periodical sources on space probes This list is by no means complete it is primarily designed to give you places to start your research through generally available works on the subject If anyone can add pertinent works to the list it would be greatly appreciated Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below I think it would be best if you started out with the general overview books in order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in this area I also recommend that you pick up some good up to date general works on astronomy and the Sol system to give you some extra background Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good public and university library Some of the more recently published works can also be purchased in and or ordered through any good mass market bookstore General Overviews in alphabetical order by

fonts I print my creations out on an HP4 Postcript at 600 dpi resolution with the Resolution Enhancement Technology and well I get some darn good copies So good that there isn t any diff whether or not ATManager is turned on or not Is it worth it to run ATM at all Especially with these better printer technologies and TT ATM will do nothing for your TrueType fonts If your TrueType fonts are sufficient for your needs don t run ATM I have a lot of fonts that I can install either as Type 1 PostScript under ATM or as TrueType I have noticed that 1 TrueType font files are at least 1 3 larger than their Type 1 equivalents If you are using a disk compressor though be aware that TrueType fonts will compress whereas Type 1 fonts will not they are encrypted 2 With a 300 dpi laser printer the artificial bold version of a TrueType font is indistingishable from the original forcing me to install the actual bold and bold italic etc variants if I want to use them Type 1 PostScript fonts under ATM generate a visually distinct bold variant from the base font I realize that the artificial bold font that ATM generates is aesthetically inferior to the hand generated bold TrueType variant but it

this area as well You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font file Mac PS Windows Unicode char set and use the characters appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on Well yes both Type 1 and TrueType fonts can contain lots of characters And in both cases plain text fonts will be reencoded to Windows ANSI in Windows and to Mac standard roman encoding on the Mac No difference there between T1 and TT And as for fonts with thousands of glyphs right know these are a liabiliaty rather than a great new thing Reason is that a font with 3000 characters is very large and if you can only access 224 of them you are paying a heavy price in downloading time and printer storage And at the moment there is only one program of that uses partial font downloading For instance all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac Windows char set in them The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set Yes and T1 text fonts all have the ISO Adobe character set which is a superset of Windows ANSI and Macintosh standard roman enocding The question is whether you can get at the glyphs In Windows for example you cannot get at the ligatures fi anfd fl both T1 and TT even though a font may very well have them ANd while it is somewhat painful to reencode a Type 1 font and to create a new Windows metric file PFM for it there are utilities out there to allow you do this How do I reencode a TrueType font How can I get at the fi and fl ligatures in Windows or on the Mac Are there

and the complexity of the glyphs related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed Probably the reason for your opinion experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the market today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font vendor or end users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being hand hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language At best these converted TT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 the hinting of diagonals for

David Glen Jacobowitz writes Is it just me or does anybody else out there NOT like digital scopes My school has David Jacobowitz Oh no you re not the only one Analogue scopes give you or me at least a fair idea of what s going on in a circuit Digital scopes seem to have a habit of inventing a sizable part of it E g even when there are only a few samples per period our HP54510A displays a continuous waveform complete with non existing overshoots I ve waded through lots of manual pages and menus but I haven t found yet how to turn this off It doesn t show which points have actually been measured as opposed to those which have been interpolated either Perhaps you re using the wrong brand Sorry all HP fans but I have a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their excellent gear One of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is whether you can turn interpolation off The other important feature is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i e being able to lock the instrument into real time capture mode Secondly I don t like menus I want to see all common functions with their own button You ll have guessed I love analogue Tek scopes I d choose a knob with printed legend over an on screen display with up down buttons right away The single knob of most digital instruments never seems to be connected to the right function at the right moment I agree with you here The only consolation is that manufacturers are _beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus However to be fair it seems that first time scope users our students seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or more knobs required of a real scope Last but not least you never know if the waveform displayed is old or recent noisy or just incoherently modulated heck you don t even know if it really looks the way it s displayed Digital scopes only show you a tiny fraction of what s going on Most of the time the re busy computing things This is one area that newer DSOs are addressing I recently evaluated the latest box from Tek their TDS320 which seems to be a worthy alternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO This instrument has a 100MHz 500Ms s spec meaning that it is _always_ in real time capture mode The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in the range The downer is that the instrument uses menus again but at least they appear to be logically laid out There are only three situations for which I would prefer a digital scope Looking at what happened before the trigger looking at rare events and acquiring the data to have my computer play with it Let s hope scope manufacturers are listening Best regards Jeroen Belleman One more thing about the new simpler front panels These instruments tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now This is a vast improvement over the old oak switch The single most common cause of failure in our scopes other than students blowing up inputs is mechanical wear on these switches I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the longevity of the instruments JohnH _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Electronics Department _ _ _ _ _ School of MPCE Macquarie

digitals I have ever seen I ve seen a lot of cheaper digitals and they look terrible I think the hangup with digital scopes is that you have to know so much more about them and how they work on a scope by scope basis and some of the functions are typically presented in my opinion in a counter intuitive fashion HP has made some strides in their 54600 series IMO Automatic setups are fine for simple repetitive waveforms but can give you some crazy results on more complex events where you need to understand how the scope is actually measuring processing the event For example is the scope in equivalent time or in real time sampling mode equivalent time being a mode where samples are built up slowly by adding a delay to the trigger event each sweep What was the scope s actual sampling rate at the time How is the data being massaged after capture but before display etc One common misconception is the speed of the scope Is the HP scope you re using really a 100 MHz scope Or is it a 20 MHz sample rate scope 5 MHz single shot significance whose front end including S H can support 100 MHz waveforms important for equivalent time sampling The 100 MHz input in this case really only helps you when your waveform is repetitive or on a single sample when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time So there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get useful information from a digital scope I prefer an analog scope for general use and the digital for events where I need storage for later analysis or comparison when the event is within the capability of the scope Now for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to fall Dave Medin Phone 205 730 3169 w SSD Networking 205 837 1174 h Intergraph Corp M S GD3004 Internet Huntsville AL 35894 UUCP uunet ingr

good restaurants racing philosophy traffic laws tickets corrosion control personalities puns double entendres culture absence of culture first rides and friendship They argue with each other and plan rides together The difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that although they get together just about everyday most have never seen each other face to face The members of this group live all over the known world and communicate with each other electronically via computer The computers range from laptops to multi million dollar computer centers the people range from college and university students to high tech industry professionals to public access electronic bulletin board users Currently rec motorcycles pronounced wreck dot motorcycles it s the file name for the group s primary on line meeting place carries about 2250 articles per month it is read by an estimated 29 000 people Most of the frequent posters belong to a motorcycle club the Denizens of Doom usually referred to as the DoD The DoD started when motorcyclist John R Nickerson wrote a couple of parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes Fellow computer enthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name Denizen of Doom A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr 0003 Keeper of the Flame Bruce was then designated DoD nr 0002 retroactively and of course Nickerson the originator of the parodies was given DoD nr 0001 The idea of a motorcycle club with no organization no meetings and no rules appealed to many so John Sloan DoD nr 0011 became Keeper of the List issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one To date there have been almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and Canada as well as Australia New Zealand the United Kingdom France Germany Norway and Finland Keeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch The initial run of 300 patches sold out immediately The profits from this went to the American Motorcycle Heritage Foundation Another AMHF fund raiser selling Denizens of Doom pins to members was started by Arnie Skurow a few months later Again the project was successful and the profits were donated to the foundation So far the Denizens have contributed over 1500 to the AMA museum A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs in the Motorcycle Heritage Museum As often as possible the DoD ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go riding together It turns out that the two largest concentrations of DoD ers are centered near Denver Boulder Colorado and in California s Silicon Valley Consequently two major events are the annual Assault on Rollins Pass in Colorado and the Northern versus Southern California Joust The Ride and Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass followed by a big barbecue dinner The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern California ride south riders from Southern California to ride north meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle An additional plan for 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction with the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus Ohio in July Though it s a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective communications hub rec motorcycles will not replace the more traditional motorcycle organizations for those who prowl the electronic pathways in search of two wheeled camaraderie it s

the electronic personalities in the newsgroup A club organized and run in the loosest sense of the word by volunteers through the network via electronic news and mail with a membership mailing list often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the same region a motto a logo a series of photo albums circulating around the country organized by DoD 9 club patches organized by 11 and even an MTV style music video produced by 47 and distributed on VHS by 18 Where will it end Who knows Will the DoD start sanctioning races placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on board engine management computers Will the DoD organize poker runs where each participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards Will the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal room and at least a 386 sized UNIX system Only time will tell The DoD has no dues no rules and no requirements other than net access and a love for motorcycles To become a member one need only ask although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few really good club secrets New members will receive via email a membership number and the latest copy of the membership list which includes name state and email address The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever or at least until next year when we may decided to change the name Live to Flame Flame to Live The

And in the words of one Denizen it intends to remain one Sometime in the far distant past a hapless newbie asked What does DoD stand for It s not the Department of Defense is it Naturally a Denizen who had watched the movie Top Gun a few times too many rose to the occasion and replied That s classified we could tell you but then we d have to kill you And the rest is history A variation on the security theme is to supply disinformation about what DoD stands for Notable contributions and contributers where known include Daughters of Democracy DoD 23 Doers of Donuts Dancers of Despair DoD 9 Debasers of Daughters Dickweeds of Denver Driveway of Death Debauchers of Donuts Dumpers of Dirtbikes Note that this is not a comprehensive list as variations appear to be limited only by the contents of one s imagination or dictionary file The rec moto photo archive First a bit of history this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck Rogers organizing a rec motorcycles photo album Many copies were made and several sets were sent on tours around the world only to vanish in unknown locations Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album Bruce has not only provided the disk space and ftp e mail access but he has taken the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive Not only can you see what all these folks look like you can also gawk at their motorcycles A few non photo files are available from the server too they include the DoD membership list the DoD Yellow Pages the general rec motorcycles FAQ and this FAQ posting Here are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how to use the archive Via ftp cerritos edu 130 150 200 21 Via e mail The address is The commands are given in the body of the message The current commands are DIR and SEND given one per line The arguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications For rec moto photo the file spec is DOD file For example you can send dir dod send dod bruce_tanner gif send dod dodframe ps and you ll get back 5 mail messages a directory listing 3 uuencoded parts of bruce_tanner gif and the dodframe ps file in ASCII Oh wildcards are allowed but a maximum of 20 mail messages rounded up to the next whole file are send A send dod gif would send 150 files of 50K each not a good idea Bruce Tanner 213 860 2451 x 596 Cerritos College Norwalk CA cerritos tanner A couple of comments Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this so why not drop him a note if you find the rec moto photo archive useful Second since Bruce has provided the server as a favor it would be kind of you to access it after normal working hours California time Patches What patches You may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches pins And your reaction was probably I want or That s sick or perhaps That s sick I want Well there s some good news and some bad news The good news is that there s been an amazing variety of DoD labeled widgets created The bad news is that there isn t anywhere you can buy any of them This isn t because of any exclusivity attempt but simply because there is no DoD store that keeps a stock All of the creations have been done by individual Denizens out of their own pockets The typical procedure is someone says I m thinking of having a DoD frammitz made they ll cost xx xx with xx xx going to the AMA museum Anyone want one Then orders are taken and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the pre paid orders is produced and quickly consumed So if you want a DoD doodad act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one Or produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling after all this is anarchy in action Here s a possibly incomplete

info on the substitutes corresponding usefullness I am currently working with the local engineers who are making sure we are compliant with the regulations The trouble with regulations is that they only tell you what you are no longer permitted to do not what you should do instead I think the cause of the new regulations is the Montreal Protocol which has a definite CFC phase out schedule Of course the cause of the Montreal Protocol was all the research done on the causes of the Ozone Depletion Problem Someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast to ban the ozone depleting CFC chemicals and not gasolines and other greenhouse gas producing compounds The greenhouse effect produced by infrared trapping gasses like CO2 and methane and the ozone hole problem produced by long lived chlorine containing molecules are not the same thing It is a lot easier to do something about not using the CFC s chloro fluorocarbons than it is to stop producing CO2 and methane which are natural byproducts of combustion and of living animal organisms Planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help the greenhouse gas problem but would do

already producing them and the potential influx from the former Soviet Union is severely blunted because the system has been raided and is starved for finances and will take a decade or two to recover

literature we muster What prevents us from going beyond being saved and extend God s rich love to others who are not Why are our eyes not wide open to see that He continuously sees our faith hope and love which glorify Him and so He gives us indications of His acknowledgements with signs miracles ordinary common or divinely inspired everywhere Isn t that like an atheist agnostic s view that all these are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural Why then does the Holy Mother comes back to remind us We must really __accept that prayer__ changes the course of things

anyone but entrust yourself to the Lord Although the Holy Mother does not insist because You are free I bow before the freedom which God gives you but she follows this with You are surprised because I say to you Decide for God and yet see how you have lived this day Why does she constantly conveys Take this life toward God in the way as to __experience__ the Lord Himself in your __behavior__ and

have fear or hate for God s current messenger of true peace love and our motherly protector from the anti Christ The one who is being apprehensive of communism wars famine and other evils that the serpent brings upon us This obedient and blessed new Eve The mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against Satan Haven t there been renewed faith hope love peace and obedience wherever this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that God has given her in good purpose Why do we choose to be blind Why fear the truth that God has been giving us a chance and sharing Christ s ever forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother The mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient harm and example done by the ancient Eve She has been preparing the new Eden with her Immaculate Heart The new Eden as sanctuary the womb for the next coming and judgement of the righteous by our Lord Jesus Christ when The Lamb marries His bride Shouldn t we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the second coming of her Son as she has been conceived without sin to bear the Son of God in her womb Why fear true peace love and renewed faith and obedience to God that Mary faithfully brings to God s children She has been protecting the flock the rest of the offsprings from the greedy dragon so as to present more righteous members for her Son s coming Not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy of belief With prayer and guidance from the Holy Spirit and of course approval of our Church authorities we should be aware of the true and divinely inspired ones specifically the ones which aligns with the Scripture Also our Lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our prayers If you speak unceasingly in your prayers how will you be able to hear God Allow Him room to answer you to speak to you She encourages us with motherly nurturing to continue in exuberant faith hope and love to Jesus constantly NOT with mere emotions but with deep constant obedience to Jesus her Beloved Son and acknowledgement of our need to have Him as part of our lives Let s not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life that God wants us to live when there won t be enough time or when it will be late Nowadays Mary says Pray pray pray for peace reconciliation my children Have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to others For without peace you can not fully accept my Son And you think she s just an ordinary lady Not to me She s our good Mother messenger

Help Organization Tektronix Inc Beaverton Or Lines 73 In article William Hargreaves writes I m a commited Christian that is battling with a problem I know that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds yet hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless saying You fools do you still think that just believing is enough Actually I don t think there is any conflict if we really understand what these passages say First what is faith If you study the meaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will come to the conclusion that the word means a lot more than mere belief Faith means both trust and action If you do not put your belief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith I think this is what James means when he says that faith without works is dead and I will show you my faith by my works Remember James was writing to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad This probably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much later and wouldn t understand the meaning of the original Greek Indeed I suspect James was writing to us today among others he intended to reach Paul on the other hand wrote mostly to the people of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of the Greek Another key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul s statements in their context I think you will find that when Paul contrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the gospel with the Law meaning the Law of Moses This was the great burden of Paul s life As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go convert a bunch of people then the Judizers would come along and try to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses cf Acts chapter 15 In this context Paul condemns the idea of being saved by the works of the Law saying that we are saved by the blood of Jesus and our faith in him I believe that a better translation for today would be that we are saved by faithfulness I think faithfulness today has a meaning closer to what the original writers intended Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves and not by God according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith I think you misunderstand Romans What Paul is really saying is that God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not keep kosher to a kosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters of following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to him i e doesn t know him condemned so a lukewarm Christian someone who knows and believes in God but doesn t make any attempt to live by the bible In the sense of faith described above you cannot have real faith and be lukewarm If you know God but are lukewarm unfaithful you are worse off than the person who never heard of Him Remember Jesus in the parable of the pearl of great price Mat 13 45 46 and again in the one on the treasure hidden in the field Mat 13 44 indicates that the price of the Kingdom of God is all we have I agree with you in general including the fact that pistis has some of the force of faithful However if you take that too far you can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have intended Being faithful means following God in all things To say that we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we are saved by commiting no sins I assume that s not what you meant I have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that completely captures this However I think Paul is describing what I d call a basic orientation including aspects such as trust and commitment Jesus speaks of it as rebirth which implies a basic change We may still do things that are sinful and may fail to show the new life in Christ in many situations where we should But in any Christian there had better be the basic change in orientation that Jesus calls being born again clh', 'From William

are Every city and suburban police officer I ve seen around the Twin Cities in the last two years has carried a semi auto of some type different brands though I haven t seen any Glock s With regard to this discussion We are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t p g and close to the realm of r g but I d like to put my two cents worth in While there s nothing wrong with a revolver especially a large frame S W in 357 magnum my favorite there are valid advantages to semi autos I suggest reading Massad Ayoob s I know some people can t stand him and think he s full of bull but I think that in general his material is very valid and useful book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ or something like that He defines a number of ways that semi auto s are different and that different is good The main advantage is not in increased firepower but in more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode There is also a certain propriatory nature of each gun that takes some familiarity to learn This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi autos but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun Define armed better Go shoot a revolver and a semi auto like the Colt 45 Does one fires faster than the other Nope Aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable Sure it makes the other guys duck for cover but just YOU trying hitting anything with a Thompson in hose mode This is why the military is limiting it s M 16 now to 3 round burst fire Simple semi auto would be better but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful A revolver is equally capable as a semi auto in the same caliber A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull the trigger again A double action revolver almost all of them can be hand cocked first but will fire merely by pulling the trigger Yes but this is best done with a two hand hold With a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock or must fire double action The DA semi auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again to rotate to the next round I m not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point In a DA semi auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round an advantage you don t have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round discussing this point now This is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation Granted it s very rare but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go Slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the hammer for maximum safety but still can be drawn and fired with an easy motion even one handed Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended A revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines on semi autos Can be faster depending on users The best speedloader users especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed This means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always take more time You also don t have the advantage of tactical reloads replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity the partial magazine can still be used if needed later A misfire in a semi auto will require you to clear a jammed shell first time spent which can be fatal And a vital second or so is often lost as you realize hey it s jammed before starting to do anything about clearing it Yes the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it Really though in either a revolver or semi auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small You are more likely to get a jam in a semi auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns Sigs Glocks et al Most semi autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round and cock the hammer Some police carry their semi autos with the chamber loaded and hammer cocked but a safety engaged I do not consider this safe however You must trade off safety to get the same speed of employment as a revolver There are some double action semi autos out there but the complexity of operation of many of them requires more training All common semi auto s can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems While I put that out as a statement that I believe I should say that this applies to all of the ones I ve looked at For the DA semi s it s no different from the revolver situation The guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks They also have a safety Because there s no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver plus the advantage of SA followup shots I m not familiar with SA semi autos except for the 1911 A1 I admit that I was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked but after examining the design trying to defeat the safeties gun unloaded of course and shooting it a lot I see no inherent safety problems with it especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer This design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver Some police departments switched to Glocks and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers Too many were having accidents partly due to the poor training they received Not that Glocks require rocket scientists but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a VCR Yeah the infamous Glock I still can t figure out how it s worse than a revolver for safety If you don t pull the trigger it doesn t go off I imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it In addition if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you d have problems when the hammer wasn t there Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don t know nothing about firearms Turn off COPS and Hunter and pay attention I do not seek here to say semi autos are junk merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid A cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot I think this is even okay for a riot as long as it s a small one B Gun control is hitting what you aim at If you whip out a wonder nine and fire real fast you may find you don t hit anything Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver If I haven t hit what I m aiming at in the first 5 shots something is quite seriously wrong somewheres While I might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases overwhelmingly the of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than 5 I have the poor man s Beretta Taurus 99 and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the Springfield 45 oops 9mm vs 45 arguments are relegated to r g You are right though If you don t hit what you aim at then the shooter gun combination has failed I don t ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder nine scenario you mention to the gun This is a shooter failure whether through lack of discipline or lack of training What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime Why the same nice simple 38 revolvers that the police often use Well actually some police prefer the much heftier 357

founded the Ordo Templi Orientis Kellner had traveled widely in the East where he met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices Kellner s efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz Hartmann Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss who had worked together prior to joining the O T O The Order was first proclaimed in 1902 in Reuss s Masonic publication Oriflamme On Kellner s death Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head O H O The Jubilee edition of the Oriflamme published in 1912 announced that the Order taught secret of sexual magic Theodore Reuss was an interesting character Born June 28 1855 in Augsburg he entered Masonry in 1876 He was a singer journalist and possibly a spy for the Prussian political police infiltrating the Socialist League founded by Karl Marx s daughter and her husband Reuss was later associated with William Wynn Westcott a leader of the Golden Dawn who later introduced him to John Yarker Yarker chartered Reuss to found the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany After several attempts to concretize various Masonic Rites Reuss settled on the development of the O T O The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss leadership For example he chartered Papus in France Rudolph Steiner in Berlin and H Spencer Lewis in the USA In 1912 the historic meeting between Reuss and Crowley occurred Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and accused him of revealing Order secrets When Crowley looked at it afresh the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for the first time Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all the English speaking world and it was this authorization that he invoked when publishing the material of the Equinox Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a stroke and named Crowley his successor All was well until 1925 when _The Book of the Law_ was translated into German There was a break in the continuity of the Order Manyk members split with the new O H O over the book which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order He had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss s request deeply infusing the doctrines of the New

of America Published by Samuel Weiser 1990 There are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this material in _Equinox III 10_ And this is the real point is it not Why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own organization Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle of Thelema Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very complex pictures with no easy answers A picture which leaves room for very many interpretations It is quite easy for me to see for example that all of O T O derived out of the dribble of faltering Masonry purchased by clever hucksters with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them And I can take that all the way down to our present Caliph whose feeble support of the Law of Thelema is laughable at best Would I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way Will I I think not Why Because my Frater will see it as a perspective an interjection I am using as an example My illustration shows that we may express things in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be quite difficult to apprehend at first So it may be with OTO and Merlinus X Please look O T O more carefully I do not support Reuss s words myself as I am not qualified to assess them and I am critical of their pomposity If I who am a member of the Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so then what can this say about the health of the Order Does it mean that the Order has gone soft and abandoned its moral principles Or does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of universal kinship arise on its own not shackled by some dogmatic requirement How shall we resolve these two possibilities I find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis They are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane or usual information They are quite often artists and geniuses Having met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area many who are or were very heavily involved with the Order I can vouch for the integrity of the organization as it stands I have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta In these moments I followed my intuition and I ve found little to stop me from requesting a Second initiation from a different O T O body I m happily participating in social groups Feasts or Initiations and have come to know the Gnostic Mass well enough for my tastes This doesn t make me an authority on Order politics and explanations however I can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my limited contact with other members I urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far There are many ways to interpret words and many people who have become involved with the Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom and the preservation of individual vision I welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response to other posts in this thread

say that Mr King was a no good black I do not know Mr King and would not make this ascertian without some evidence to this effect I used it PURELY as a descriptive adjective in the same manner than many most news people have used it in the past The entire second trial was about race Ted I don t feel compelled to discuss Mr King s racial background but had Mr King been white there would not have been a second trial You probably are saying that the beating would not have occurred if he were white but that is an extremely difficult call to make It is possible the case but not definately I still

excuses Nobody who can handle a mail buffer can claim they are too young to remember Ronald Reagan yet The eighties were about How America Learned to Win Once Again Then wouldn t you know we won so well that there was nothing left to win No Cold War to endure No nuclear holocaust No more worlds to conquer We forgot about outer space long ago The kind of overwhelming no holds barred success that killed Alexander the Great Yes there were a few little problems along the way stock market meltdown here an S L bailout there a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to contend with but as

there is still no suggestion of losing But what do we find now To put it mildy the stereotype of our white male non winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl punching out photojournalists when those

to worry about who is a winner and who is a loser to tell whose side you are on That could be black women today Asian homosexuals tommorrow and yes indeed white men some yet to be determined day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that 39 minority Or you can just blow the whole thing off and say as do most conservatives and all the libertarians and act is if you didn t care who s

are winners are insecure people who are afraid to be associated with something negative The political implications are simple If as many socialists and Democrats do you consider society a finite pie

indeed white men some yet to be determined day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that 39 minority On this one point I agree The reason that people bash WASP s is because they have been on top for a long time Whoever is on top is going to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top If Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we might all be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people for all these centuries I seriously doubt that if the blacks had conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any better worse than the whites did The white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of the world But they only did what any other conquering race would have done ie Khan The real question is should we carry over that blame to the present generation who didn t participate in the crimes Would it do any good Has it done Bosnia any good They are fighting wars that stopped hundreds even thousands of years ago My opinion is if there are inequities now then let s change them But don t blame me for what my ancestors did It wouldn t settle anything anyway Either way you go the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be popular at least after you graduate from High School but you ll still be popular at High School reunions But it beats being a Nerd as I would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree and in the long run it is the only way to go That s where you are dead wrong You don t join up on a side just because they are winning That makes you spineless Winning in high school and after high school is still the best way to be popular but it doesn t make you right All the best causes in history were loosing causes with only a couple exceptions Winning only makes a difference to other people not to yourself And what good is the opinions of other people if they only care how you appear ie a Winner If you can t beat them fight them every inch of the way Bill R At that moment

practices here A few points need to be clarified The Equipment GROUNDING conductor Green green with a yellow stripe bare or the metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods is used as a safety ground to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects It should never except for a few exceptions to be discussed later carry the normal operating current of a connected load Some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation orange outlets are often used for this with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box and in many cases back to the service Anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems The code requires the insulated grounding conductors green wires to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box and if required back all the way to the service entrance where it is bonded to the service ground water pipe or rod Many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit often called the NEUTRAL which is referred to in the code as the identified conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point generally at the service entrance panel This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper In many household service panels the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel The Grounded conductor neutral is generally a current carrying conductor In the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device Since the grounded conductor neutral is only connected to the grounding conductor bare or green at the service entrance if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load under normal operating conditions If you should incorrectly connect the grounded neutral conductor to the grounding conductor at the load some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor Since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end If the load equipment has a metal case which is connected to the grounding conductor through the U ground plug the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential The difference under normal non short circuit conditions may be only a few tenths of a volt but it could also be a volt or two This normally does not present a shock hazard HOWEVER if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe a radiator a metal air conditioning duct or such part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path If the contact is not solid you will get a significant arc a low voltage but possibly moderate current arc Under the wrong conditions this arcing could start a fire It is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current could also flow through a wire of inadequate size causing it to overheat With the incorrect non single point grounding of the neutral if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor which increases the possibility for shock or fire Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment often causing malfunction I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling This is done primarily for lightning protection so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer Some of it flows through the grounding electrode water pipe etc this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop between the hot conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy don t flame ME on this I m just telling you where the field comes from not it s health effect as far as I m concerned the jury is still out on this Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel NOT at any sub distribution panels This is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral The sheath can be used in this application only as the groundING conductor If the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground with the possible problems listed above The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers as well as feeds from one building to another In the cases of the range and dryer the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions instead of a seperate wire Every time the code is revised these exceptions come up for review These exceptions were in fact the first required safety grounds in the days before U ground outlets and such The appliance manufacturers don t want to have to redesign their ranges and driers and the contractors don t want to have to run four wire cable with four fairly heavy expensive wires in place of three wire to the appliances No question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove but the neutral current is low for most burner settings since most current is in the 220 volt hots except at some low settings the wires are large gauge and there are few reported cases of injury or damage So far the exceptions have survived In the case of feeds between buildings it s primarily for lightning protection People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn t a legal grounding conductor Obviously the bare wire in romex with ground is Anywhere there is a green wire installed such as in a portable cord that is a good grounding conductor The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor in the US BX has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath You can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends you don t have to bond it to anything it does its job by touching every turn of the BX sheath Conduit or EMT thinwall tubing is generally a legal grounding conductor but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel particularly for larger pipes Greenfield looks like big BX but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it is NOT a legal grounding conductor as it doesn t have the aluminum band to bond it and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield Wiremold is also not a legal grounding conductor as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact and the feed to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were hot with 120 volts Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator here in the office because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box You must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring conduit BX etc where you can bond the wire to the box with a screw bnding clip or whatever On another issue while you should ground the green wire lug on GCFI outlets when ever there is a place to ground them it is legal in the NEC to use them without a ground if no ground is available It is better to have the protection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don t install it The interrupter doesn t depend on the ground to trip It is desirable to connect the ground if available because if the ground is connected the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in whereas without the ground it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded GCFI s read in the NEC 210 7 d exception This is the 1990 code my 93 code is in the city but I know the rule hasn t changed It might be renumbered though We have only touched the surface concerning grounding there is much more to this subject but

2424', 'From Subject Re A question about 120VAC outlet wiring Organization Kernel Mode Systems San Diego CA Lines 43 In article Russ Crisp writes I m considering modernizing some old wiring in my home and I need a little advice on outlet wiring Several outlets are the old two prong type without the ground Naturally the wire feeding these outlets is 12 2 WITHOUT the ground wire I noticed at the fusebox that some circuits have the 12 2 with ground and that on these circuits the ground wire was tied to the same bus as the neutral white wire SO Here s my question It seems to me that I d have the same electrical circuit if I hooked the jumper from the neutral over to the ground screw on new three prong grounding outlets What s wrong with my reasoning here No No NOOO The ground green wire is for safety No current is supposed to flow in it under normal conditions This means that there s normally no voltage drop in it either It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire even if you re grounded in some other way at the same time The neutral white wire is as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said the return for the hot wire Since current flows in it there s a voltage drop If you plug a heavy load into a properly wired grounded outlet you can commonly measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel but nowhere repeat NOwhere else Well almost There are strange exceptions for things like sub panels What you CAN do if you want three prong outlets without additional wiring is to use a GFCI outlet or breaker but the outlet will be cheaper In fact depending on where you are putting your new outlet s a GFCI may be required There is a FAQ on electrical wiring posted regularly to rec woodworking and

weird stuff Old style wiring Where do I buy stuff Subject Introduction Disclaimers Although we ve done a fair bit of wiring we are not electricians and we cannot be responsible for what you do If you re at all uncertain about what is correct or safe don t do it Contact someone qualified a licensed electrician or your local electrical inspector Electricity is no joke mistakes can result in shocks fires or electrocution Furthermore our discussion is based on the U S National Electrical Code NEC and the Canadian Electrical code CEC To the best of our abilities we have confirmed every detail with the electrical code but we don t quote sections simply to keep this thing readable If you think we re wrong we invite you to correct us but please quote references The NEC and the CEC do not in and of themselves have the force of law Many municipalities adopt it en toto Others however do not Check your with your local building department and provincial Hydro Inspection Offices in Canada to find out what applies in your area Also your local electrical utility may also have special requirements for electrical service installation Bear in mind too that we say here applies primarily to ordinary single family residences Multi family dwellings mobile homes commercial establishments etc are sometimes governed by different rules Also note that contrary to popular belief in the U S and in some parts of Canada Canada is not a wholly owned subsidiary of the U S Consequently the NEC does not apply in Canada Lots of things are the same including voltages line frequencies and the laws of physics But there are a number of crucial differences in the regulations Where we can we ve noted them flagging the relevant passages with NEC or CEC Remember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards It is often smart to go beyond their minimal requirements Subject What is the NEC Where can I get a copy The NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the National Fire Protection Association an insurance industry group It s revised every three years The 1993 version has been released You can buy a copy at a decent bookstore or by calling them directly at 800 344 3555 The code exists in several versions There s the full text which is fairly incomprehensible There s an abridged edition which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses And there s the NEC Handbook which contains the authorized commentary on the code as well as the full text That s the recommended version Unfortunately there s no handbook for the abridged edition And the full handbook is expensive US 65 plus shipping and handling Subject What is the CEC Where can I get a copy The Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up of various government agencies power utilities insurance companies electrical manufacturers and other organizations The CSA publishes CSA Standard C22 1 which is updated every two or three years Each province adopts with some amendments this standard and publishes a province specific code book Since each province publishes its own slightly modified standard it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA standard itself In this FAQ CEC really means the appropriate provincial standard In particular this FAQ is derived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code 20th edition 1990 Which is in turn based on CSA C22 1 1990 16th edition While differences exist between the provinces an attempt has been made to avoid specific to Ontario detail The appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical inspection offices of your provincial power authority In Ontario it s Ontario Hydro The Ontario Hydro book isn t overly fat It s about C 25 and includes mailed updates I hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the equivalent NEC publications Don t bother asking in Quebec DIY wiring is banned throughout the province Subject Can I do my own wiring Extra pointers In most places homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring In some they re not Check with your local electrical inspector Most places won t permit you to do wiring on other s homes for money without a license Nor are you permitted to do wiring in commercial buildings Multiple dwellings eg duplexes are usually considered semi commercial or commercial However many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi commercial wiring if you re supervised by a licensed electrician if you can find one willing to supervise If you do your own wiring an important point Do it NEAT and WELL What you really want to aim for is a better job than an electrician will do After all it s your own home and it s you or your family that might get killed if you make a mistake An electrician has time pressures has the skills and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast safe job In this FAQ we ve consciously given a few recommendations that are in excess of code because we feel that it s reasonable and will impress the inspector The inspector will know that you re an amateur You have to earn his trust The best way of doing this is to spend your time doing as neat a job as possible Don t cut corners Exceed specifications Otherwise the inspector may get extremely picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions Don t try to hide anything from the inspector Use the proper tools Ie don t use a bread knife to strip wires or twist wires with your fingers The inspector won t like it and the results won t be that safe And it takes longer And you re more likely to stick a hunk of 12ga wire through your hand that way Don t handle house wire when it s very cold eg below 10C or 16F Thermoplastic house wire particularly older types become very brittle Subject What do I need in the way of tools First there s the obvious a hammer a drill a few screwdrivers both straight and Phillips head If you re lucky enough to live in Canada or find a source of CSA approved devices you need Robertson square recess screwdrivers 1 and 2 instead of phillips For drilling a few holes a 3 4 or 1 spade bit and 1 4 or 3 8 electric drill will do If you re doing a lot or are working with elderly lumber we recommend a 1 2 drill right angle drills are wonderful Can be rented and 3 4 or 1 screw point auger drill bits These bits pull you through so they re much faster and less fatiguing even in 90 year old hardwood timbers Screw driver bits are useful for drills expecially if you install your electrical boxes using screws drywall screws work well For stripping wire use a real wire stripper not a knife or ordinary wire cutters Don t buy the 3 K mart combo stripper crimper and bottle opener types You should expect to pay 15 to 20 for a good plier type pair It will have sized stripping holes and won t nick or grab the wire it should be easy to strip wire with it One model has a small hole in the blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals There are fancier types autostrip cut but they generally aren t necessary and pros usually don t use them A pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends in constricted places Don t use these for stripping wire You will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts You should have a pair of needle nose pliers for fiddling inside boxes and closing loops but it s better to form wire loops with a loop former hole on your wire stripper more accurate If you re using non metallic cable get a cable stripper for removing the sheath Or do what some pros do they nick the end of the sheath grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a zipper and cut the sheath off You shouldn t try to strip the sheath with a knife point because it s too easy to slash the insulation on the conductors Apparently Stanley utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters hooked blades can be used to strip sheath but there is still the possibility that you ll gouge the conductors For any substantial amount of work with armored cable it s well worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter US 18 Hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire or the insulation Three prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly wired outlets About 6 Multimeters tell you more but are a lot more expensive and probably not worth it for most people A simple voltage sensor which can detect potential through an insulated wire not supplying any devices is extremely helpful they cost about US 10 at Radio Shack You should have a voltage detector to check that the wires are dead before doing work on them Neon bulb version are cheap 2 3 and work well If you get more serious a audible alarm type is good for tracing circuits without a helper Though I ve been known to lock the drill on and hit breakers until the scream stops For running wires through existing walls you need fish tape Often two tapes are needed though sometimes a bent hanger or a length of thin chain will suffice Fish tapes can be rented Electrical tape Lots of it Seriously a good and competent wiring job will need very little tape The tape is useful for wrapping dicy insulation in repair work Another use is to wrap around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination screws I don t do this but drywall contractors prefer it to prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet that has no cover plate Subject What is UL listing The UL stands for Underwriters Laboratory It used to be an Insurance Industry organization but now it is independent and non profit It tests electrical components and equipment for potential hazards When something is UL listed that means that the UL has tested the device and it meets their requirements for safety ie fire or shock hazard It doesn t necessarily mean that the device actually does what it s supposed to just that it probably won t kill you The UL does not have power of law in the U S you are permitted to buy and install non UL listed devices However insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to the failure of a non UL listed device Furthermore in many situations the NEC will require that a wiring component used for a specific purpose is UL listed for that purpose Indirectly this means that certain parts of your wiring must be UL listed before an inspector will approve it and or occupancy permits issued Subject What is CSA approval Every electrical device or component must be certified by the Canadian Standards Association before it can be sold in Canada Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done with CSA approved materials They perform testing similar to the UL a bit more stringent except that CSA approval is required by law Again like the UL if a fire was caused by non CSA approved equipment your insurance company may not have to pay the claim In Canada there is a branch organization of the UL called ULC UL of Canada ULC does not have power of law and seems to be more a liason group between the CSA and insurance companies Subject Are there any cheaper easier to read books on wiring USA The following three books were suggested by our readers Residential Wiring by Jeff Markell Craftsman Books Carlsbad CA for 18 25 ISBN 0 934041 19 9 Practical Electrical Wiring Residential Farm and Industrial Based on the National Electrical Code ANSI NFPA 70 Herbert P Richter and W Creighton Schwan McGraw Hill Book Co Wiring Simplified H P Richter and W C Schwan Park Publishing Co Try to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC revision Which is currently 1990 Canada P S Knight authors and publishes a book called Electrical Code Simplified There appears to be a version published specific to each province and is very tied into the appropriate provincial code It focuses on residential wiring and is indispensible for Canadian DIY ers It is better to get this book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring or answer questions on the net It is updated each time the provincial codes are This book is available at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C 10 Subject Inspections how and what Why should I get my wiring inspected Most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and inspections of any wiring that is done Amongst other more mundane bureaucratic reasons like insurance companies not liking to have to pay claims a permit and inspections provides some assurance that you your family your neighbors or subsequent owners of your home don t get killed or lose their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job Most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your home or order you to tear out any wiring done without a permit California for instance is particularly nasty about this If fire starts in your home and un inspected wiring is at fault insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage claims In general the process goes like this you apply to your local inspections office or building department for a permit You should have a sketch or detailed drawing of what you plan on doing This is a good time to ask questions on any things you re not sure of If you re doing major work they may impose special conditions on you require loading calculations and ask other questions At this point they will tell you which inspections you will need If you re installing a main panel you will need to have the panel and service connections inspected before your power utility will provide a connection This is sometimes done by the local power authority rather than the usual inspectors After installing the boxes and wiring but before the insulation walls go up you will need a rough in inspection After the walls are up and the wiring is complete you will need a final inspection Subject My house doesn t meet some of these rules and regulations Do I have to upgrade In general there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings though there are some exceptions ie smoke detectors in some cases However any new work must be done according to the latest electrical code Also if you do major work you may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all of your system Check with your local electrical inspector Subject A word on voltages 110 115 117 120 125 220 240 One thing where things might get a bit confusing is the different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of a circuit One person might talk about 110V another 117V or another 120V These are all in fact exactly the same thing In North America the utility companies are required to supply a split phase 240 volt 5 feed to your house This works out as two 120V 5 legs Additionally since there are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring it s not unreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped to 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet Especially at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run For a number of reasons some historical some simple personal orneryness different people choose call them by slightly different numbers This FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them 110V and 220V except when actually saying what the measured voltage will be Confusing A bit Just ignore it One thing that might make this a little more understandable is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower ie 110V instead of 120V value What this implies is that the device is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that low 208V is not the same as 240V 208V is the voltage between phases of a 3 phase Y circuit that is 120V from neutral to any hot 480V is the voltage between phases of a 3 phase Y circuit that s 277V from hot to neutral In keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness motors intended to run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V Subject What does an electrical service look like There are logically four wires involved with supplying the main panel with power Three of them will come from the utility pole and a fourth bare wire comes from elsewhere The bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded into the ground or to a wire buried in the foundation or sometimes to the water supply pipe has to be metal continuous to where the main water pipe entering the house Watch out for galvanic action conductivity breaks often between copper and iron pipe This is the grounding conductor It is there to make sure that the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground This wire normally carries no current One of the other wires will be white or black with white or yellow stripes or sometimes simply black It is the neutral wire It is connected to the centre tap CEC center tap in the NEC of the distribution transformer supplying the power It is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place often inside the panel The neutral and ground should not be connected anywhere else Otherwise weird and or dangerous things may happen Furthermore there should only be one grounding system in a home Some codes require more than one grounding electrode These will be connected together or connected to the neutral at a common point still one grounding system Adding additional grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house wiring is unsafe and contrary to code If you add a subpanel the ground and neutral are usually brought as separate conductors from the main panel and are not connected together in the subpanel ie still only one neutral ground connection However in some situations certain categories of separate buildings you actually do have to provide a second grounding electrode consult your inspector The other two wires will usually be black and are the hot wires They are attached to the distribution transformer as well The two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each other This means if you connect something to both hot wires the voltage will be 220 volts If you connect something to the white and either of the two blacks you will get 110V Some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them This is either because the neutral and ground are connected together at a different point eg the meter or pole and one wire is doing dual duty as both neutral and ground or in some rare occasions the service has only one hot wire 110V only service Subject What is a circuit Inside the panel connections are made to the incoming wires These connections are then used to supply power to selected portions of the home There are three different combinations 1 one hot one neutral and ground 110V circuit 2 two hots no neutral and ground 220V circuit 3 two hots neutral and ground 220V circuit neutral and or two 110V circuits with a common neutral 1 is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and lighting within your house 3 is usually used for supplying power to major appliances such as stoves and dryers they often have need for both 220V and 110V or for bringing several circuits from the panel box to a distribution point 2 is usually for special 220V motor circuits electric heaters or air conditioners Note In the US the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar to 2 be used for stoves and dryers namely that there are two hot wires and a wire that does dual duty as neutral and ground and is connected to the frame as well as providing the neutral for 110V purposes three prong plugs instead of four only for stoves dryers connected to the main panel When connected to most sub panels 4 prong plugs and receptacles are required In our not so humble opinion this is crazy but the NFPA claims that this practice was re evaluated for the 1992 NEC and found to be safe Check your local codes or inquire as to local practice there are restrictions on when this is permissible 1 is usually wired with three conductor wire black for hot white for neutral and bare for grounding 2 and 3 have one hot wire coloured red the other black a bare wire for grounding and in 3 a white wire for neutral You will sometimes see 2 wired with just a black white and ground wire Since the white is hot in this case both the NEC and CEC requires that the white wire be permanently marked at the ends to indicate that it is a live wire Usually done with paint nail polish or sometimes electrical tape Each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the panel through a circuit breaker or fuse There are in a few locales circuits that look like 1 2 or 3 except that they have two bare ground wires Some places require this for hot tubs and the like one ground is frame ground the other attaches to the motor This may or may not be an alternative to GFCI protection Subject grounding versus grounded versus neutral According to the terminology in the CEC and NEC the grounding conductor is for the safety ground i e the green or bare wire The word neutral is reserved for the white when you have a circuit with more than one hot wire Since the white wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the panel the proper term is grounded conductor However the potential confusion between grounded conductor and grounding conductor can lead to potentially lethal mistakes you should never use the bare wire as a grounded conductor or white wire as the grounding conductor even though they are connected together in the panel But not in subpanels subpanels are fed neutral and ground separately from the main panel Usually In the trade and in common usage the word neutral is used for grounded conductor This FAQ uses neutral simply to avoid potential confusion We recommend that you use neutral too Thus the white wire is always except in some light switch applications neutral Not ground Subject What does a fuse or breaker do What are the differences Fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels For example if your toaster shorts out a fuse or breaker should trip protecting the wiring in the walls from melting As such fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the wiring UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the equipment itself won t cause a fire Fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt safely when the current exceeds the rated value thereby interrupting the power to the circuit Fuses trip relatively fast Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have large startup current surges For motor circuits you can use a time delay fuse one brand is fusetron which will avoid tripping on momentary overloads A fusetron looks like a spring loaded fuse A fuse can only trip once then it must be replaced Breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices They usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched into position against another contact When the current flow through the device exceeds the rated value a bimetallic strip heats up and bends By bending it trips the latch and the spring pulls the contacts apart Circuit breakers behave similarly to fusetrons that is they tend to take longer to trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses With high overloads they trip quickly Breakers can be reset a finite number of times each time they trip or are thrown when the circuit is in use some arcing takes place which damages the contacts Thus breakers should not be used in place of switches unless they are specially listed for the purpose Neither fuses nor breakers limit the current per se A dead short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time which can often cause severe damage Subject Breakers Can t I use fuses Statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher risk of causing a fire than breaker panels This is usually due to the fuse being loosely screwed in or the contacts corroding and heating up over time or the wrong size fuse being installed or the proverbial replace the fuse with a penny trick Since breakers are more permanently installed and have better connection mechanisms the risk of fire is considerably less Fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload When a fuse explodes the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting path Result from complete meltdown of the electrical panel melted service wiring through fires in the electrical distribution transformer and having your house burn down Breakers don t do this Many jurisdictions particularly in Canada no longer permit fuse panels in new installations The NEC does permit new fuse panels in some rare circumstances requiring the special inserts to key the fuseholder to specific size fuses Some devices notably certain large air conditioners require fuse protection in addition to the breaker at the panel The fuse is there to protect the motor windings from overload Check the labeling on the unit This is usually only on large permanently installed motors The installation instructions will tell you if you need one Subject What size wire should I use For a 20 amp circuit use 12 gauge wire For a 15 amp circuit you can use 14 gauge wire in most locales For a long run though you should use the next larger size wire to avoid voltage drops 12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than 14 gauge though it s stiffer and harder to work with Here s a quick table for normal situations Go up a size for more than 100 foot runs when the cable is in conduit or ganged with other wires in a place where they can t dissipate heat easily Gauge Amps 14 15 12 20 10 30 8 40 6 65 We don t list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent on the application and precise wire type Subject Where do these numbers come from There are two considerations voltage drop and heat buildup The smaller the wire is the higher the resistance is When the resistance is higher the wire heats up more and there is more voltage drop in the wiring The former is why you need higher temperature insulation and or bigger wires for use in conduit the latter is why you should use larger wire for long runs Neither effect is very significant over very short distances There are some very specific exceptions where use of smaller wire is allowed The obvious one is the line cord on most lamps Don t try this unless you re certain that your use fits one of those exceptions you can never go wrong by using larger wire Subject What does 14 2 mean This is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors in a cable The first number specifies the gauge The second the number of current carrying conductors in the wire but remember there s usually an extra ground wire 14 2 means 14 gauge two insulated current carrying wires plus bare ground 2 wire usually has a black white and bare ground wire Sometimes the white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral In the latter case the sheath is usually red too 3 wire usually has a black red white and bare ground wire Usually carrying 220V with neutral Subject What is a wirenut marrette marr connector How are they used A wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that s used to connect wires together Marrette or Marr connector are trade names You ll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring In essence you strip the end of the wires about an inch twist them together then twist the wirenut on Though some wirenuts advertise that you don t need to twist the wire do it anyways it s more mechanically and electrically secure There are many different sizes of wire nut You should check that the wire nut you re using is the correct size for the quantity and sizes of wire you re connecting together Don t just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or your fingers Use a pair of blunt nose linesman pliers and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly Sometimes it s a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it goes in the wirenut properly Some people wrap the open end of the wirenut with electrical tape This is probably not a good idea the inspector may tear it off during an inspection It s usually done because a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut instead of taping it the connection should be redone Subject What is a GFI GFCI A GFCI is a ground fault circuit interrupter It measures the current current flowing through the hot wire and the neutral wire If they differ by more than a few milliamps the presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other path This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of an appliance or to the ground lead or through a person Any of these situations is hazardous so the GFCI trips breaking the circuit GFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks If for example you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral leads of a circuit and no part of you was grounded a GFCI wouldn t help All of the current that passed from the hot lead into you would return via the neutral lead keeping the GFCI happy The two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric One is labeled LOAD the other LINE The incoming power feed must be connected to the LINE side or the outlet will not be protected The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices downstream from it Thus a whole string of outlets can be covered by a single GFCI outlet Subject Where should GFCIs be used The NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V 15A or 20A single phase outlets in bathrooms kitchens within 6 of the sink garages unfinished basements or crawl spaces outdoors near a pool or just about anywhere else where you re likely to encounter water or dampness There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets those dedicated to appliances occupying fixed space typically refrigerators and freezers and for sump pumps and laundry appliances The CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs In particular there is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets or most garage or basement outlets Basement outlets must be protected if you have a dirt floor garage outlets if they re near the door to outside Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs Even if you are not required to have GFCI protection you may want to consider installing it anyway Unless you need a GFCI breaker see below the cost is low In the U S GFCI outlets can cost as little as US 8 Costs are a bit higher in Canada C 12 Evaluate your own risk factors Does your finished basement ever get wet Do you have small children Do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools Does water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage Subject Where shouldn t I use a GFCI GFCIs are generally not used on circuits that a don t pose a safety risk and b are used to power equipment that must run unattended for long periods of time Refrigerators freezers and sump pumps are good examples The rationale is that GFCIs are sometimes prone to nuisance trips Some people claim that the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary current imbalance tripping the GFCI Note though that most GFCI trips are real if you re getting a lot of trips for no apparent reason you d be well advised to check your wiring before deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless Subject What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker For most situations you can use either a GFCI outlet as the first device on the circuit or you can install a breaker with a built in GFCI The former is generally preferred since GFCI breakers are quite expensive For example an ordinary GE breaker costs US 5 the GFCI model costs US 35 There is one major exception if you need to protect a multi wire branch circuit two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire such as a Canadian style kitchen circuit you ll need a multi pole GFCI breaker Unfortunately these are expensive the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars depending on what brand of panel box you have But if you must protect such a circuit say for a pool heater you have no choice One more caveat GFCI outlets are bulky You may want to use an oversize box when installing them On second thought use large actually deep boxes everywhere You ll thank yourself for it Incidentally if you re installing a GFCI to ensure that one specific outlet is protected such as a bathroom you don t really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first outlet in the circuit you could simply find the first outlet in the bathroom and not GFCI anything upstream of it But protecting the whole circuit is preferred When you install a GFCI it s a good idea to use the little ground fault protected stickers that come with it and mark the outlets downstream of the GFCI You can figure out which outlets are downstream simply by tripping the GFCI with the test button and see which outlets are dead Subject What s the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet then Apart from their use in electronics which we won t comment on and for certain fluorescent lights they won t turn on without a good ground connection they re intended to guard against insulation failures within the device Generally the case of the appliance is connected to the ground lead If there s an insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case the ground lead conducts the electricity away safely and possibly trips the circuit breaker in the process If the case is not grounded and such a short occurs the case is live and if you touch it while you re grounded you ll get zapped Of course if the circuit is GFCI protected it will be a very tiny zap which is why you can use GFCIs to replace ungrounded outlets both NEC and CEC There are some appliances that should never be grounded In particular that applies to toasters and anything else with exposed conductors Consider if you touch the heating electrode in a toaster and you re not grounded nothing will happen If you re slightly grounded you ll get a small shock the resistance will be too high But if the case were grounded and you were holding it you d be the perfect path to ground Subject Why is one prong wider than the other Polarization Nowadays many two prong devices have one prong wider than the other This is so that the device could rely not guaranteed on one specific wire being neutral and the other hot This is particularly advantageous in light fixtures where the the shell should neutral safety or other devices which want to have an approximate ground reference ie some radios Most 2 prong extension cords have wide prongs too This requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right way around You want the wide prong to be neutral and the narrow one hot Most outlets have a darker metal for the hot screw and lighter coloured screw for the neutral If not you can usually figure out which is which by which prong the terminating screw connects to Subject What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen The NEC requires at least two 20 amp small appliance circuits for kitchens The CEC requires split duplex receptacles Outlets must be installed such that no point is more than 24 NEC 900 mm CEC from an outlet Every counter wider than 12 NEC or 300 mm CEC must have at least one outlet The circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except in the kitchen pantry or dining room Furthermore these circuits are in addition to any required for refrigerators stoves microwaves lighting etc Non dedicated outlets within 6 of a sink must be protected by a GFCI NEC only Split duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit The tab is broken on the hot side of the outlet and one hot goes to the upper outlet and the other hot goes to the lower outlet The neutral connects to both outlets through one screw When carrying through to another outlet the neutral must be pigtailed such that removing the outlet or having the neutral connection fall off doesn t cause the neutral to disconnect from downstream outlets Subject Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms There must be at least one outlet in each bathroom adjacent to the sink in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in the light fixture All such outlets must be GFCI protected Subject What is Romex NM NMD What is BX When should I use each Romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire Sometimes called non metallic sheath The formal name is NM This is suitable for use in dry protected areas ie inside stud walls on the sides of joists etc that are not subject to mechanical damage or excessive heat Most newer homes are wired almost exclusively with NM wire There are several different categories of NM cable BX cable technically known as armored cable or AC has a flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is fairly resistant to damage TECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic sheath Protection for cable in concealed locations where NM or AC cable is run through studs joists or similar wooden members the outer surface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm 1 25 CEC NEC from the edges of the wooden members or the cable should be protected from mechanical injury This latter protection can take the form of metal plates such as spare outlet box ends or conduit Note inspector permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored cable or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection but this is technically illegal Additional protection recommendations these are rules in the Canadian codes they are reasonable answers to the vague references to exposed to mechanical damage in both the NEC and CEC NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor Ie use AC instead flexible conduit wooden guards etc Where cable is suspended as in connections to furnaces or water heaters the wire should be protected Canadian practise is usually to install a junction or outlet box on the wall and use a short length of AC cable or NM cable in flexible conduit to jump to the appliance Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating ducts or pipe heat transfer should be minimized by means of a 25mm 1 air space or suitable insulation material a wad of fiberglass NM cable shall be supported within 300mm 1 of every box or fitting and at intervals of no more than 1 5m 5 Holes in joists or studs are considered supports Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to each box while fishing cable is technically in violation it is permitted where proper support is impractical 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge Knight also insists on only one cable per staple referring to the workmanship clause but this seems more honoured in the breach cable should never be buried in plaster cement or similar finish cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more than 1m 39 Whenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp small plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through the insulation BX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by solid wall coverings In places where damage is more likely like on the back wall of a garage you may be required to use conduit a UL or CSA approved metal pipe You use various types of fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance exit for the wire Service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit In damp places eg buried wiring to outdoor lighting you will need special wire eg CEC NMW90 NEC UF NMW90 looks like very heavy duty NMD90 You will usually need short lengths of conduit where the wire enters exits the ground See underground wiring section Thermoplastic sheath wire such as NM NMW etc should not be exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that purpose Many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through furnace ducts including cold air return plenums constructed by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces The reason for this is that if there s a fire the ducting will spread toxic gasses from burning insulation very rapidly through the building Teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas Canada appears to use similar wire designations to the US except that Canadian wire designations usually include the temperature rating in Celsius Eg AC90 versus AC In the US NM B is 90 degrees celcius NOTE local codes vary This is one of the items that changes most often Eg Chicago codes require conduit everywhere There are very different requirements for mobile homes Check your local codes especially if you re doing anything that s the slightest out of the ordinary Wire selection table incomplete the real tables are enormous uncommon wire types or applications omitted Condition Type CEC NEC Exposed Concealed dry plastic NMD90 NM armor AC90 AC TECK90 Exposed Concealed damp plastic NMD90 NMC armor ACWU90 TECK90 Exposed Concealed wet plastic NMWU90 armor ACWU90 TECK90 Exposed to weather plastic NMWU TW etc armor TECK90 Direct earth burial plastic NMWU UF Service entrance RWU TWU armor RA90 TECK90 ACWU90 NMWU not for service entrance Subject Should I use plastic or metal boxes The NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non metallic cable only The reasoning is simple with armored cable the box itself provides ground conductor continuity U S plastic boxes don t use metal cable clamps The CEC is slightly different The CEC never permits cable armor as a grounding conductor However you must still provide ground continuity for metallic sheath The CEC also requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes The advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for non metallic sheathed cable you can avoid making one ground connection and they sometimes cost a little less On the other hand plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts For exposed or shop wiring metal boxes are probably better Subject Junction box positioning A junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together Junction boxes must be located in such a way that they re accessible later Ie not buried under plaster Excessive use of junction boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation and inspectors may get nasty Subject Can I install a replacement light fixture In general one can replace fixtures freely subject to a few caveats First of course one should check the amperage rating of the circuit If your heart is set on installing half a dozen 500 watt floodlights you may need to run a new wire back to the panel box But there are some more subtle constraints as well For example older house wiring doesn t have high temperature insulation The excess heat generated by a ceiling mounted lamp can and will cause the insulation to deteriorate and crack with obvious bad results Some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high temperature wire only You may find in fact that your ceiling wiring already has this problem in which case replacing any devices is a real adventure Other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some fluorescent fixtures and making sure that the ceiling box and its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy chandelier or ceiling fan You may need to install a new box specifically listed for this purpose A 2x4 across the ceiling joists makes a good support Metal brackets are also available that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and mounted between the joists There are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as pot lamps or heat lamps When these are installed in insulated ceilings they can present a very substantial fire hazard The CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated ceilings provided that the fixture is boxed in a coffin usually 8 x16 x12 made by making a pair of joists 12 high and covering with plywood that doesn t have any insulation Yes that s 8 feet long NEC rules are somewhat less stringent They require at least 3 clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation The rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement which means that a CEC style coffin might be worthwhile Presumably that s up to the local inspector The CEC doesn t actually mandate the coffin per se this seems to be an inspector requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can t get accidentally buried in insulation Ie if you have insulation blown in later There are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation They are usually limited to 75 watt bulbs and are unfortunately somewhat more expensive than the older types Before you use them you should ensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses Follow the installation instructions carefully the prescribed location for the sensor can vary There does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved for use in insulation The coffin appears the only legal approach Subject What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts This usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is loose Depending on the load balance one hot wire may end up being more than 110V and the other less than 110V with respect to ground This is a very hazardous situation it can destroy your electronic equipment possibly start fires and in some situations electrocute you ie some US jurisdictions require the stove frame connected to neutral If this happens contact your electrical authority immediately and have them come and check out the problem Note a brief 1 second brightening is sometimes normal with lighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit A loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness far longer than one second In case of doubt get help Subject What is 3 phase power Should I use it Can I get it in my house Three phase power has three hot wires 120 degrees out of phase with each other These are usually used for large motors because it is more efficient provides a bit more starting torque and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper You re most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows 110 volts between any hot and ground and 208 volts between any two hots The latter shows the difference between a normal 220V 110V common neutral circuit which is 240 volts between the two hots There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages Bringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually ridiculously expensive or impossible If the equipment you want to run has a standard motor mount it is MUCH cheaper to buy a new 110V or 220V motor for it In some cases it is possible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have a capacitor start unit or use a larger motor as a auto generator These are tricky but are a good solution if the motor is non standard size or too expensive or too big to replace The Taunton Press book The Small Shop has an article on how to do this if you must Note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using such a converter The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that Subject Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220 Theoretically it doesn t make any difference However there is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply wiring All things being equal a 220V motor will lose 4 times less power in the house wiring than a 110V motor This also means that the startup surge loss will be less and the motor will get to speed quicker And in some circumstances the smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life This is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more than 50 feet long Subject What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits It is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746 watts Given heating loss power factor and other inefficiencies it is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000 1200 watts A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor so it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP Given rational efficiency factors 1 5HP is more like it Some equipment manufacturers Sears in particular most router manufacturers in general advertise a HP rating that is far in excess of what is possible They are giving you a stall horsepower or similar That means the power is measured when the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load What they don t mention is that if you kept it in that condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker will trip otherwise the motor will melt it s drawing far more current than it can continuously When comparing motors compare the continuous horsepower This should be on the motor nameplate If you can t find that figure check the amperage rating which is always present Subject How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong Older homes frequently have two prong receptacles instead of the more modern three These receptacles have no safety ground and the cabling usually has no ground wire Neither the NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore There are several different approaches to solving this 1 If the wiring is done through conduit or BX and the conduit is continuous back to the panel you can connect the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle box NEC mainly CEC frowns on this practise 2 If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby and it s continuous to the main house ground point you can run a conductor to it from the third prong 3 Run a ground conductor back to the main panel 4 Easiest install a GFCI receptacle The ground lug should not be connected to anything but the GFCI protection itself will serve instead The GFCI will also protect downstream possibly also two prong outlets If you do this to protect downstream outlets the grounds must not be connected together Since it wouldn t be connected to a real ground a wiring fault could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected to other outlets Be sure though that there aren t indirect ground plug connections such as via the sheath on BX cable The CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three prong if you fill the U ground with a non conducting goop Like caulking compound This is not permitted in the NEC Subject Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets Should the test button work We re sure about what the NEC and CEC say Remember though that your local codes may vary As for the TEST button there s a resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE side of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button Current through this resistor shows up as an imbalance and trips the GFCI This is a simple passive and reliable test and doesn t require a real ground to work If your GFCI does not trip when you press the TEST button it is very probably defective or miswired Again if the test button doesn t work something s broken and potentially dangerous The problem should be corrected immediately The instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground wire must be connected We do not know why they say this The causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet or with the formalities of UL or CSA listing perhaps the device was never tested without the ground wire being connected On the other hand UL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device behaves properly in all listed applications including ungrounded outlet replacement One of us called Leviton their GFCIs are labeled for installation on grounded circuits only The technician was surprised to see that he agreed that the NEC does not require it and promised to investigate Subject How should I wire my shop As with any other kind of wiring you need enough power for all devices that will be on simultaneously The code specifies that you should stay under 80 of the nominal capacity of the circuit For typical home shop use this means one circuit for the major power tools and possibly one for a dust collector or shop vac Use at least 12 gauge wire many power tools have big motors with a big start up surge If you can use 20 amp breakers NEC though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles which means you d have to replug all your equipment Lights should either be on a circuit of their own and not shared with circuits in the rest of the house or be on at least two separate circuits The idea is that you want to avoid a situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand RPM while you re groping in the dark for the OFF switch Do install lots of outlets It s easier to install them in the beginning when you don t have to cut into an existing cable It s useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each point so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same time as the tool you really want But use metal boxes and plates and maybe even metal sheathed cable you may have objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit wrong Note that some jurisdictions have a no horizontal wiring rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used for working What this means is that all wiring must be run along structural members Ie stapled to studs Other possible shop circuits include heater circuits 220V circuits for some large tools and air compressor circuits Don t overload circuits and don t use extension cords if you can help it unless they re rated for high currents A coiled extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of the same gauge Also the insulation won t withstand as much heat and heat dissipation is the critical issue If your shop is located at some remove from your main panel you should probably install a subpanel and derive your shop wiring from it If you have young children you may want to equip this panel with a cut off switch and possibly a lock If you want to install individual switches to safe particular circuits make sure you get ones rated high enough For example ordinary light switches are not safely able to handle the start up surge generated by a table saw Buy horsepower rated switches instead Finally note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished basements hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply And even if you know that you d never use one of your shop outlets to run a lawn mower the next owner of your house might have a different idea Note Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop wiring April 1992 is one place to start Subject Underground Wiring You will need to prepare a trench to specifications use special wire protect the wire with conduit or special plastic tubing and possibly lumber don t use creosoted lumber it rots thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion of lead The transition from in house to underground wire is generally via conduit All outdoor boxes must be specifically listed for the purpose and contain the appropriate gaskets fittings etc If the location of the box is subject to immersion in water a more serious style of water proof box is needed And of course don t forget the GFCIs The required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction so we suggest you consult your inspector about your specific situation A hint buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says buried power line and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed Subject Aluminum wiring During the 1970 s aluminum instead of copper wiring became quite popular and was extensively used Since that time aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations We recommend even if you re allowed to that do not use it for new wiring But don t panic if your house has aluminum wiring Aluminum wiring when properly installed can be just as safe as copper Aluminum wiring is however very unforgiving of improper installation We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential problems and what you can do to make your wiring safe The main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as cold creep When aluminum wiring warms up it expands When it cools down it contracts Unlike copper when aluminum goes through a number of warm cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each time To make the problem worse aluminum oxidises or corrodes when in contact with certain types of metal so the resistance of the connection goes up Which causes it to heat up and corrode oxidize still more Eventually the wire may start getting very hot melt the insulation or fixture it s attached to and possibly even cause a fire Since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move into a house built during the 70 s we will cover basic points of safe aluminum wiring We suggest that if you re considering purchasing a home with aluminum wiring or have discovered it later that you hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring for the following things 1 Fixtures eg outlets and switches directly attached to aluminum wiring should be rated for it The device will be stamped with Al Cu or CO ALR The latter supersedes the former but both are safe These fixtures are somewhat more expensive than the ordinary ones 2 Wires should be properly connected at least 3 4 way around the screw in a clockwise direction Connections should be tight While repeated tightening of the screws can make the problem worse during the inspection it would pay off to snug up each connection Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the main service entrance cable It should be inspected 3 push in terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire Any connections using push in terminals should be redone with the proper screw connections immediately 4 There should be no signs of overheating darkened connections melted insulation or baked fixtures Any such damage should be repaired 5 Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be handled specially Current Canadian codes require that the wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting aluminum to copper The NEC requires that the wire be connected together using special crimp devices with an anti oxidant grease The tools and materials for the latter are quite expensive not practical to do it yourself unless you can rent the tool 6 Any non rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring by means of a short copper pigtail See 5 above 7 Shows reasonable workmanship neat wiring properly stripped not nicked wire etc If when considering purchasing a home an inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two we believe that you can consider the wiring safe If there are signs of problems in many places we suggest you look elsewhere If the wrong receptacles are used you can replace them with the proper type or use pigtails having this professionally done can range from 3 to 10 per receptacle switch You can do this yourself too Subject I m buying a house What should I do Congratulations But It s generally a good idea to hire an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas Not just for wiring but plumbing and structural as well If an inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor ones we believe that you can consider the wiring safe after any minor problems are fixed If there are signs of problems in many places we suggest you look elsewhere Here s some hints on what to look for Obvious non code wiring can include Zip cord wiring either concealed or nailed to walls Hot wiring on the identified neutral conductor without proper marking Ungrounded grounding outlets except when downstream of a GFCI Splices hanging in mid air other than proper knob and tube Switched neutrals Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines Certain wiring practises that are actually to code or were at one time sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations Switches that seem to control nothing abandoned perhaps not properly terminated wiring A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are separately controlled by other wall switches except when it s really convenient Switches and outlets in bizarre locations Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or ceiling Backwrapped grounding wires Subject What is this weird stuff Old style wiring In the years since Edison invented electricity several different wiring styles have come and gone When you buy an older home you may encounter some of this stuff This section describes the old methods and some of their idiosyncrasies The oldest wiring system you re likely to encounter is called knob and tube K T It is made up of individual conductors with a cloth insulation The wires are run along side structural members eg joists or studs using ceramic stand offs knobs Wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes Connections were made by twisting the wire together soldering and wrapping with tape Since the hot and neutral were run separately the wiring tends to be rather confusing A neutral often runs down the centre of each room with taps off to each fixture The hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next In some cases K T isn t colour coded so the neutral is often the same colour as the hot wires You ll see K T in homes built as late as the 40 s Comments on K T the people installing K T were pretty paranoid about electricity so the workmanship tends to be pretty good The wire insulation and insulators tend to stand up very well Most K T I ve seen for example is in quite good condition No grounding Grounding is usually difficult to install boxes are small Receptacle replacement particularly with GFCI can be difficult No bushing on boxes either so wiring changes need special attention to box entry Sometimes the neutral isn t balanced very well between separately hot circuits so it is sometimes possible to overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on any circuit Building code does not permit insulation in walls that contain K T Connection to existing K T from new circuits can be tricky Consult your inspector Modern wiring practise requires considerably more outlets to be installed than K T systems did Since K T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn t necessary to replace it simply because it s K T What you should watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and be cautious about circuit loading In many cases it s perfectly reasonable to leave existing K T alone and add new fixtures on new circuits using modern techniques After K T they invented multi conductor cable The first type you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation It looks much like the romex cable of the last decade or two This stuff was used in the 40 s and 50 s Again no grounding conductor It was installed much like modern wiring Its major drawback is that this type of insulation embrittles We ve seen whole systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at a touch BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems This stuff is very fragile and becomes rather hazardous if the wires become bare This wiring should be left untouched as much as possible whenever an opportunity arises replace it A simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat shrink tubing After this wiring technique the more modern romex was invented It s almost a asphalt impregnated cloth Often a bit sticky This stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn t present a hazard and is reasonably easy to work with It does not need to be replaced it should be considered as safe as the modern stuff thermoplastic insulation wire Just don t abuse it too much Subject Where do I buy stuff Try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you Their prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or DIY centres have better quality materials have wider variety including the odd stuff and have people behind the counter that know what you re talking about Cultivate friendly knowledgeable sales people They ll give you much valuable information Chris Lewis Phone Canada 613 832 0541 Psroff 3 0 info Ferret

With all of God s power He certainly can do whatever He wants when He wants it The Bible ends with the book of Revelations But does God s reign end there No So who can say for sure that God s messages are either no longer happening or still happening I can now hear the clamor for proof 8 With the cold response I ve gotten from the past from this group it s very hard to get the point across I ll only go over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look at documents stored somewhere I ve cited the uncorrupted bodies of saints before They re still there 8 The apparitions at Fatima Portugal culminated in a miracle specifically granted to show God s existence That was the spinning descending of the sun It was seen in several countries That event is approved by the Pope Currently images of

heal And doctor s don t know why Non believers are welcome to pore through documents I m sure This stuff is not like Koresh Or Oral Roberts give me 5M or God will call me home It s free Find out why they re happening as we ourselves are studying why If anybody can figure this out tell us You can be of any religion If you have the resources go to one of the countries I mentioned These are not

now but I m trying to finish writing my Thesis and don t have tons of time Anyway The basis for our the catholic church s belief in the assumption of Mary body and soul into heaven is that to put it simply the apostles and all the early generation Christians believed it In fact throughout their ministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary and 11 of the 12 were present when she died Only Thomas was missing when he arrived several days later he asked to be shown her body and moved with pity Peter and several of the other apostles brought him to her tomb When they arrived the seal was still unbroken They broke the seal entered and the body was missing There was no sign that anyone had entered forcibly or otherwise and everything else was laid out exactly as it had been left The apostles present all believed that Mary was assumed into heaven and the apostles TAUGHT this in their preaching of course this does not appear in any of the texts currently considered part of the bible but it does appear in other writings left behind by several of them Basicaly as an apostolic church ie founded by the apostles we believe that the teachings of the apostles whether written down in the bible or written down in other sources is true providing that the authenticity of those other sources can be confirmed At least in the case of the assumption of Mary the authenticity is quite clear Hope this helps I would welcome anyone who has more information to add to what I ve said Mike Walker Univ of Illinois', 'From Marida Ignacio Subject Re What WAS the immaculate conception Organization trunking_fixed Lines 111 Note I am cross posting actually emailing this to bit listserv catholic while main posting goes to soc religion christian Quotations omitted This is in response to a question about the Immaculate Conception I explained it but left justification up to our Catholic readers clh There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the mention of Mary s _blessedness_ full of grace in the Annunciation by Angel Gabriel in Luke 1 26 28 And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David and the virgin s name was Mary And the angel came unto her and said _ Hail thou that art highly favoured the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women _ Now now hold that line of thought the Lord is with Mary blessed art thou among women while you read on In the book First Lady of the World A Popular History of Devotion to Mary by Peter Lappin The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated than the _Assumption_ This arose in 430 AD It is quite possible that the feast of _Mary s Conception_ under the title The Conception of Saint Anne originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing conceiving a daughter just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist A transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_ Mary is the incorruptible timber out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_ of Christ s sinless body she is God s Eden in whom there is no tree of knowledge and no serpent that harms Her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ her purity in that of the Father At the time of the Council of Ephesus she was hailed as innocent without blemish immaculate inviolate spotless holy in soul and body who was blessed as a lily from among thorns unlearned in the evil ways of Eve At the end of the thirteenth century an Irish Franciscan John Duns Scotus 1266 1308 God maintained that it was a greater thing for Him to preserve His the Son mother from all sin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_ Now let s go to the discussion of baptism and original sin From Pocket Catholic Cathechism by John A Hardon Baptism Concupiscence Remains after Baptism Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of Christ Jesus manfully resist Canon 5 Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall In the light of the foregoing we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times over They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the power to think and to choose freely The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality and of integrity or the internal power to control desires They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace the virtues of faith hope and charity and the corresponding title to enter heaven By their disobedience they lost the _supernatural and preternatural_ gifts entirely and were weakened without losing their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam s sin It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day Going back to _Immaculate Conception_ I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the puzzle Given the miracle of St Anne bearing a child at a non childbearing age AND Christ was not yet born AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary s birth but STILL the Angel Gabriel s greetings was Hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with you Blessed art thou amongst women Even Mary was confused about this greeting Mary could very well have possessed all of the _treefold original gifts above_ given to our first parents Adam and Eve before their sin Hail Mary Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel Full of grace natural preternatural supernatural The Lord is with you At those times God would definitely want to be with those He has made _blessed_ Blessed art thou amongst women that says it all At the conception God made Mary _full of grace and blessed_ as the tabernacle for the coming body of Christ and so Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still has maintained her Immaculate Heart Marida P S I do hope that others will continue more light and facts on this matter

Re Ancient Books Organization Tektronix Inc Beaverton Or Lines 106 I sent in something on this before but I believe it got lost in the weekend accident the moderator described This is an improved version anyway so no loss the first time HL The standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents is probably the writing of Friedrich Blass Hermeneutrik und Kritik _Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen_ vol 1 of _Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums wissenshaft_ Noerdlingen Beck 1886 Portions of this are described in Nibley _The Prophetic Book op Mormon_ pp 219 242 SLC Deseret Book 1989 If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned Nibley describes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims little knowledge of his subject then proceeds to exhaust both the subject and the reader Nibley s extract from Blass s work is in the form of rules for forgers It makes interesting reading I confess that I have not read Blass s work only Nibley s extract thereof My German falls far short of what would be required and as far as I know there is no English translation available However I believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient document and at least determine if it is consistent with what one would expect of a genuine document of that time frame We will not be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and culture or is a later forgery Actually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents 1 Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof For example the Dead Sea Scrolls These can be tested by various scientific means to determine the age of the paper inks and objects found with them This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual physical objects 2 Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the copy itself may be much more recent For example we might find a document which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something from centuries ago perhaps even having been through several generations of copists This is more of a problem but can still be tested although the test is not likely to be simple We cannot expect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so we must confine our testing to the text itself It is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if the document is really what it claims to be They can only date the document and identify its culture of origin For example I ve heard of a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a king in what is now Iraq If this document were to actually turn up scholars could date the paper and ink assuming they have the holograph They could check the language content and writing style to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a Palestinian Jew of that time However even if all test results were positive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actually wrote it We would know what time and culture it came from but barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for comparison scholarship must stop there There is seldom any way to determine who the actual author was As I say I m no expert on Blas s work I do remember some of the tests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works Specifically we might ask 1 Is the document internally consistent Does it contradict itself If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to maintain internal consistency even if it is a forgery The longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency For this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents 2 Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time Again a short non specific work might not be testable but if the writing is of any significant length no latter day forger would be able to escape detection Here we look for the minor inconspicuous things which someone from that culture would get right without even thinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous and trivial to check The devil is in the details 3 What about the literary style of the work figures of speech etc Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that seem strange to us Are there any such odd phrases in this book If so do they fit in with the culture Of course there are complications if the document has been translated or possibly even if somebody just updated language when he copied it A few cases of language not from the culture claimed may be allowed in recent copies They cause problems and reduce certainty to be sure but don t necessarily prove forgery These tests can be quite effective given enough material to work with but they are not easy They require the skills of the historian the linguist the anthropologist etc The questions to ask are Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we know about the culture of claimed origin If there are things which don t fit how significant are they Are problem areas due to our lack of knowledge later changes by copists or are they really significant There will often be some ambiguity since we never know everything about the culture The end result of any such testing is occasionally certain particularly in the case of holographs or other ancient copies However often it may just be a probability or an indication that the document or maybe parts of it is probably authentic or sometimes maybe other parts are later additions This is often unsettling to a generation raised on TV where all problems are solved in 30 to 60 minutes with time out for commercials It is however the real world and what scholarship has to offer', 'From Charley Wingate Subject

prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a real story that is a bigger headline Let s back up to 1935 At this point we have the Masoretic text the various targums translations commentaries in aramaic etc and the Septuagint the ancient greek translation The Masoretic text is the standard Jewish text and essentially does not vary In some places it has obvious corruptions all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy These passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and to the Septuagint Now the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars first it includes additional texts and second in some passages there are variant readings from the masoretic text in addition to fixing predating the various corrupted passages It must be emphasized that to the best of my knowledge these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars and have little theological import The dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient copy of almost all of Isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books There is also an abundance of other material but as far as I know there is no sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha the extra texts in the septuagint As far as analysis has proceeded there are also variations between the DSS texts and the masoretic versions These tend to reflect the septuagint where the latter isn t obviously in error Again though the differences thus far are not significant theologically There is this big expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the material but so far

discussed this with my girlfriend often I consider myself married though legally I am not Neither of us have been with other people sexually although we have been with each other We did not have sexual relations until we decided to marry eventually For financial and distance reasons we will not be legally married for another year and a half Until then I consider myself married for life in God s eyes I have faith that we have a strong relationship and have had for over 4 years and will be full of joy when we marry in a church First however we must find a church we will be living in a new area when we marry and will need to find a new church community Anyway I feel that if two people commit to marriage before God they are married and are bound by that commitment Rick Szanto Rick has nailed the problem down pretty well As I can find no Scripture have I missed it that details when you are married I have to make some assumptions based on the PRINCIPLES of Scripture It seems to me that it takes 3 parties to make a marriage husband to be wife to be and God If you promise before each other and God that you will convenant together to be married then you are IMO So why do we have the ceremonial part That seems to be there for connectedness in the Body of Christ My brothers and sisters ought to be involved so that there can be some accountability on both our parts That s part of the concept from Hebrews about not forsaking the assembling of yourselves together as is the custom of some We need each other because Lone Ranger Christians and Lone Ranger Marriages smack of a self sufficiency that the I don t see in the NT Does anyone see the Paul Simon I am a rock I am an island model anywhere in Christianity Song lyrics show your age Further since marriage is a legal matter institution in the USA and many other places and such laws do not specifically go crosswise to the clear teachings of Scripture we ought to obey them to avoid even the appearance of evil I Thess 5 22 So this would imply at least a civil ceremony before marriage but keep in mind we are at least doing all of this for the conscience of others because back to the beginning you are married when you and your intended promise each other and God to be in convenant IMO What ch all think Bobby akgua rjb In some states the kind of commitment described in Richard Szanto s posting can create a

and are unswervingly committed to one another I realize this is a subjective qualifier they are married joined in God s sight The way I read Scripture a couple becomes married when they are physically married i e when they first have sexual intercourse e g the end of Genesis 2 quoted from memory for this reason a man shall leave his parents and be joined to his wife and they will become one flesh Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage If you read through Genesis in particular you will often come across the phraseology man lay with woman and she became his wife This implies that she became his wife when they lay together i e at the point of intercourse Compare this with Jewish tradition Joseph when he heard that Mary was pregnant had it in mind to divorce her quietly but Mary and Joseph were betrothed not married i e they were in a binding relationship which required a divorce to get out of but marriage would not occur until Mary and Joseph went to bed together Compare with Christ and the Church Ephesians 5 Revelation 19 the church is described as the bride of Christ but the marriage of the Lamb takes place when Jesus returns i e we are in a binding love relationship with Jesus but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will take place I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God In summary engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship but it is not marriage A civil ceremony is not marriage either Marriage occurs at the point when the betrothed couple go to bed together I don t mean to demean the civil or church ceremony ours was great I don t mean to be too pedantic Historically I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony i e a marriage recognised by the state has only been around in the West since Napoleon who introduced it to keep tabs on the people although I m ready to be corrected on that point This view obviously raises some questions What about those who have had sex with one or more partners without considering marriage Are those people also married If it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse is it necessary to be married in the eyes of the state I would say Yes because this honours the laws of our nations in the West Although it is not illegal to sleep together though unmarried in most Western countries I believe that it is God honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before actually consummating our marriage Its to do with our being salt and light and also to do with how people will perceive us i e it is culturally insensitive to declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony Michael Davis And hast thou

in those long ago OT days if you weren t 100 correct in your prophecies people got very mad and you were no longer believed even put to death This is one of the differences between OT prophecy and NT prophecy In the NT it is expected that when believers gather people will prophesy the prophecy must be judged 1 Cor 14 29 There is nothing about killing someone who makes a mistake To say that we make mistakes is true To say that we make mistakes while filled with the spirit is not true Were that true the entire Bible having been written by men inspired by God would be subject also to those errors for what is prophecy but like those revelations given in scripture Scripture is scripture there is no gift of scripture And I don t know about you but I know that _I_ have made mistakes while filled with the spirit If you don t give grace to allow people to make mistakes they will never grow in the use of the spiritual gifts When we minister in my small group I encourage people to speak out any impressions or images they think might be from the Lord Only by trying will they know whether they were right or wrong and in either case they ll have a better handle on it the next time Didn t you fall when you were learning to ride a bicycle But you kept on trying and you learned both from your failures and your successes Spiritual gifts are no different you get better with experience Which brings me around to asking an open question Is the Bible a closed book of Scripture Is it okay for us to go around saying God told me this and Jesus told me that Wouldn t that imply that God is STILL pouring out new revelation to us I know that some people will feel that is okay and some will not The concept of a closed canon would certainly cast a shadow on contemporary prophets On the other hand an open canon seems to be indicated sometimes The canon of Scripture is complete Does this mean that God no longer speaks I have heard his voice not audibly though some have but clearly nonetheless Is what I heard equivalent to Scripture No I have never heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the Lord is on the same level as Scripture on the contrary those who are mature obey the Scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow believers for judgement And the most reliable yardstick for judging prophecies is certainly the Scriptures themselves The canon is closed but God is not silent Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new but rather an inspired translation of scripture Is it right to call that prophecy Misleading Wouldn t that be more having to do with knowledge I know the gift of knowledge may not be as exciting to talk about but shouldn t we call a horse a horse Does it matter what it is called The question is not how to label it but how to receive it Words of knowledge incidentally are similar to prophecy and sometimes the two overlap but generally it is supernatural knowledge of some fact that could not be known

Lines 130 In article trajan Stephen McIntyre writes In article writes I can only reply with what it says in 1 Timothy 3 16 I m not here to discount parts of the Bible Rather I m here only to discount the notion of revelation The author of 1 Timothy told what he thought was the truth based on his belief in God his faith in Jesus as the resurrected Son and his readings of the Old Testament But again what had been revealed to him was based on at best second hand information given by friends and authors who may not have given the whole truth or who may have exaggerated a bit First of all the original poster misquoted The reference is from 2 Tim 3 16 The author was Paul and his revelations were anything but at best second hand And is came about that as Saul journeyed he was approaching Damascus and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him and he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him Saul Saul why are you persecuting Me And he said Who art Thou Lord And He said I am Jesus whom you are persecuting Acts 9 3 5 NAS Paul received revelation directly from the risen Jesus Pretty cool eh He became closely involved with the early church the leaders of which were followers of Jesus throughout his ministry on earth Now you may say The Holy Spirit revealed these things unto him and we could go into that argument but you d be hard pressed to convince me that the Holy Spirit exists I agree I don t believe anyone but the Spirit would be able to convince you the Spirit exists Please don t complain about this being circular I know it is but really can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural This is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the Bible Additionally what he has written is again second hand info if it were given by the Spirit and still carries the chance it is not true The Spirit is part of God How much closer to the source can you get The Greek in 2 Timothy which is sometimes translated as inspired by God literally means God breathed In other words God spoke the actual words into the scriptures Many theologians and Bible scholars Dr James Boice is one that I can remember off hand get quite annoyed by the dryness and incompleteness of inspired by God The only way you would be able to escape this notion of second hand info is to have had the entire Bible written by God himself And to tell the truth I ve studied the Bible extensively and have yet to hear of scholars who have put forth objective evidence showing God as the first author of this collection of books That s what the verse taken from 2 Timothy was all about The continuity of a book written over a span of 1500 years by more than 40 authors from all walks of life is a testimony to the single authorship of God And as for reason read what it says in 1 Corinthians 1 18 31 about human wisdom Basically it says that human wisdom is useless when compared with what God has written for our learning If you knew of Jesus as well as you know the Bible you d realize he reasoned out the law and the prophets for the common man What source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior historicity to the Bible Certainly not Josephus writings or the writings of the Gnostics which were third century at the earliest And though some claim Jesus was he was human with all of the human wisdom the apostle Paul set out to criticize Yet would you not embrace the idea that Jesus was wise Jesus was fully God as well That s why I d assert that he is wise I realise that you may not accept the authority of the Bible This is unfortunate to say the least because there is no other way of learning about God and Christ and God s purpose with the earth than reading the Bible and searching out its truth for yourself For your information I was raised without any knowledge of God By the time some of the faithful came to show me the Word and share with me its truth I was living happily and morally without acknowledging the existence of a supreme being I have though read the Bible several times over in its entirety and have studied it thoroughly It contains truth in it and I consider Jesus to be one of the most moral of human beings to have lived in fact I darn near idolize the guy But there s no rational reason for me to except God s existence Please rethink this last paragraph If there is no God which seems to be your current belief then Jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not only did he assert that God exists but he claimed to be God himself regards to C S Lewis How then could you have the least bit of respect for Jesus In conclusion be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based on gut feelings about the text and other scholars unsubstantiated claims The Bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out About your reading of the Bible not only does the Spirit inspire the writers but he guides the reader as well We cannot understand it in the least without the

_____________________________________________________________________ MY REPLY Vary noble of you Dave I didn t want to have to go to x number of sources to show you wrong Although I am researching CHORION a little DB Of course the only other reference Mr DeCenso has given is Bullinger And Bullinger uses such ridiculous exegisis that when I accused Mr DeCenso of actually believing Bullinger he replied that I misquoted him And you maintain that you find such exegesis convincing Oh dear My Reply Your misquotes of me are astounding Dave Read the beginning of this part of my response to see what I REALLY said in my posting of this article Actually Mr DeCenso you said that there was benefit to our argument in that it caused to to rediscover Bullinger s exegisis I did not realize that you would find such garbage beneficial unless you were convinced by it MY REPLY Thank you for correcting your restating of my points DB and Mr DeCenso also replied Dave these are not necessarily my views they are Bullinger s WE will discuss the land issue in later posts I m sure I m only responding to this one you have directed re Bullinger s views because it s enjoyable Thus I apologize for thinking that even Mr DeCenso could find such drek convincing he should specify which parts of Bullinger he finds convincing and quit hiding behind a disingenuous mask of This is what Bullinger believed not necessarily what I believe So which is it Mr DeCenso Do you find the exegisis convincing or not MY REPLY One of my purposes in debating these alleged contradictions with you and others is to diseminate many different views of possible reconciliations raised by various Bible scholars and students alike When I present MY VIEWS I will clearly distinguish them from now on DB Of course without Archer and Bullinger we find that Mr DeCenso has presented no Greek exegisis at all and Mr DeCenso has made a big thing about my not referring back to the actual Greek Thus we find this demand on his part for quality Greek exegisis to be a hypocritical requirement MY REPLY Good point But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory you have produced only superficial reasonings and observations Nor have you dug deeper I m glad you have begun in this post I will begin Greek studies on these passages in more depth than I thought necessary as well DB It would be appropriate to look at what Mr DeCenso has actually USED as evidence Now we know what he claims for a standard as he has stated it often enough a the text itself b parallel passages c other pertinent Scriptures d historical context e historical content f other pertinent historical info g cultural context h cultural content i other pertinent cultural info j grammatical construction k Hebrew and Greek word studies l etc But are these actual standards he has used or simply empty hyperbole Let s see he has used a and since he is trying to reconcile it to other passages we see that he has also used b On the other hand he has presented no use of d historical context or e historical content or f other pertinent historical info or g cultural context or h cultural content or i other pertinent cultural info or j grammatical construction or even k Hebrew and Greek word studies remember Archer and Bullinger don t count Thus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings MY REPLY Question Do you find such criteria important If so do you plan on starting to use them to the best of your ability or will you continue to present shallow observations I don t mean this in a bad way At this point in our _debates_ I have not found it necessary to present a total exegetical analysis of these passages since we seem to keep beating around the bush and not getting into the core of the verses I do not believe it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re Judas in Acts and Matthew but I will do my best from this point on to use several of the above criteria since you desire me to I hope you will also It will greatly enhance our study of these passages DB The only thing he has actually used beyond the passage itself is any other passage Thus Mr DeCenso should be honest and note that most of his list is red herring and his only real criteria seems to be a the text itself b parallel passages MY REPLY The reason is simple you are mistating the passages You claim that the PASSAGES contradict one another I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one another 1 They may very well be complimentary as many scholarly sources mention 2 Matthew may not be presenting Judas death as you claim But we ll look at your defense of this later Also the reward of iniquity in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of silver in Matthew s PASSAGES Although you have a valiant attempt later at stating why you believe it is At this beginning stages in our debates we are laying some Scriptural groundwork which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis DB Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage as he has done with Judas death is to make it agree with another passage so that both could be considered correct MY REPLY One of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these passages are complimentary However I see no problem in Tony Rose s explanation of Judas death _____________________________________________________________________ HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING HIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27 5 AND FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN This question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are constantly confronted in our travels Many people point to the apparent discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious irreconcilable error Some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is destroyed by these contradictory accounts However this is not the case at all Matthew relates that Judas hanged himself while Peter tells us he fell and was crushed by the impact The two statements are indeed different but do they necessarily contradict each other Matthew does not say that Judas did not fall neither does Peter say that Judas did not hang himself This is not a matter of one person calling something black and the other person calling it white Both accounts can be true and supplementary A possible reconstruction would be this Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom After he hung there for some time the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge mangling his body in the process The fall could have been before or after death as either would fit this explanation This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom is examined From the bottom of the valley you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom Therefore it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down tearing his body open It is important to remember that we are not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced was the decomposition of his body before his fall Louis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself This individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a pistol at his head He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at the same time On the other hand a person could say that this man took his life by shooting himself while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping form the tall building In this case both are true as both are true in the case of Matthew s and Peter s accounts of the death of Judas It is merely a situation of different perspectives of the same event _____________________________________________________________________ Your only reason for rejecting this is I believe your attempt to discredit inerrancy You haven t related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely Here s what you said in an earlier post _____________________________________________________________________ DB quoting Tony Rose There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom Therefore it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down tearing his body open It is important to remember that we are not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced was the decomposition of his body before his fall The added text in this version is so heavy that assuming you are truly so opposed to such tactics you should find it not credible But you seem to find Tony Rose s eisegesis satisfactory while clearly rejecting David Joslin s _____________________________________________________________________ Here you discredit Tony s explanation based on what you deem too heavy for the passages But you haven t addressed why you feel that way You can say it s a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction but that doesn t tell me it didn t happen nor have you shown why you reject that possibility Questions Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying Or are they both lying Or are either or both of them misinformed Why do you think there is such an alleged contradiction I do not think you have ever told us what you believe in this respect DB At present though Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me 1 You claim Acts and Matthew contradict one another in representing Judas death I ask you again to provide evidence that Matthew stated Judas died in the hanging 2 You claim that the 30 pieces of silver in Matthew that Judas threw down in the temple and the chief priests used is the reward of iniquity in Acts that pictures Judas in some way purchasing a field with therefore there is a contradiction Prove that the 30 pieces of silver and the reward of iniquity are one and the same Actually I find question 1 to be a rather stupid request but I will answer it because he now restricts himself to two points First I would point out that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life In fact it is a bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging except in fantasy cowboy movies and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging MY REPLY I work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect Today I got a call re a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother is on crack He failed in his attempt and is in a child s psych ward at a local hospital Hanging attempts are not always successful To assume that because most hangings are successful this one was also is begging the question if I may quote you Last night listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast The Christian Research Institute s show one of the scholars on there used several of these terms that you use I am not all that familiar with them The man on the BAM show teaches Comparative Religion and Logic It was interesting DB This is so prevalent that so that to say a man hung himself with no other qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself MY REPLY Qualifiers are important at times as we ll see in an OT passage I ll mention below Does hanging ALWAYS have this outcome Did Matthew who is the only source we have re Judas hanging himself state that Judas died as a result To say it s synonymous means it has the same meaning as A boy age 14 hung himself But he lived This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can discover DB Now I am not alone in this thought in fact since Mr DeCenso so respects Christian scholarly including Greek scholars opinion I did some research MY REPLY Thank you Dave DB Interestingly not one of the Christian references I read interpreted the hanging as being anything but a fatal suicide MY REPLY above mine So it s OK to use Christian sources to back your points What about Tony s position Do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility Also is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong or lying or deceived in other parts of their books If so should we do as we have done with Archer toss them to the side and not value anything they say including their interpretation of the hanging of Judas I am sure _you_ would find some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources You also noted they interpreted the hanging as meaning he died Although that is very possibly true do you find that in the text itself Remember that s the first criteria we must examine DB This included The Biblical Knowledge Commentary by Woodward and Zuck MY REPLY Which I own It s a good source of commentary info But not inerrant DB The Interpreters on Volume Commentary on the Bible by Laydon The one volume Bible Commentary by J R Dunelow Word meanings of the Testament Ralph Earl The Abingdon Bible Commentary published by Abingdon Harpers Bible Commentary by William Neal Actually I could have presented many more as well MY REPLY I appreciate your doing this research Dave Maybe we are getting somewhere in how we both should approach these alleged contradictions more in depth study DB In each case these references specifically describe that the interpretation of Matt 27 5 as successful suicide and thus I can only conclude that the Greek word apagchw ie hang oneself is translated as a successful hanging MY REPLY above mine No you can t only conclude this although as Tony says this was a highly probable outcome But Matthew does not state death as being a result The Greek word is APAGCHO Matthew 27 5 is it s only occurrence in the New Testament In the Septuagint the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus it s only used in 2 Samuel 17 23 Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed he saddled a donkey and arose and went home to his house to his city Then he put his household in order and hanged himself and died and he was buried in his father s tomb Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel hanged himself Gr Sept APAGCHO but it explicitly adds and died Here we have no doubt of the result In Matthew we are not explicitly told Judas died Also there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure It simply means hang oneself DB But Mr DeCenso you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable Christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful MY REPLY above mine Reputable You mean ones that have never erred As far as insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful that can t be done even by me As I said in an earlier post _____________________________________________________________________ Although I still agree with Tony s exegesis as being the most probable explanation regarding Judas death taking into account several criteria I ve recently noticed some new things in Matthew MAT 27 5 8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went and hanged himself But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said It is not lawful to put them into the treasury because they are the price of blood And they consulted together and bought with them the potter s field to bury strangers in Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day First of all notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of hanging All it says is that he went and hanged himself Luke however in Acts tells us that and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out This is a pretty clear indication along with the other details given in Acts Peter s speech the need to pick a new apostle etc that at least after Judas fall he was dead So the whole concept that Matthew and Luke both recount Judas death is highly probable but not clear cut _____________________________________________________________________ I also wrote _____________________________________________________________________ MY REPLY Here we have a stickler Dave that I have to say I just recently noticed Let s look at the passage in Matthew MAT 27 4 saying I have sinned by betraying innocent blood And they said What is that to us You see to it MAT 27 5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went and hanged himself MAT 27 6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said It is not lawful to put them into the treasury because they are the price of blood MAT 27 7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter s field to bury strangers in MAT 27 8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day Notice verse 5 Then he went and hanged himself Matthew does not say Judas died does it Should we assume he died as a result of the hanging What does Acts say ACT 1 18 Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out ACT 1 20 For it is written in the book of Psalms Let his dwelling place be desolate And let no one live in it and Let another take his office Here we may have a graphic explanation of Judas death So my line of reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re the two accounts of Judas death is this Matthew doesn t necessarily explain how Judas died he does say Judas hanged himself but he didn t specifically say Judas died in the hanging incident However Acts seems to show us his graphic demise Therefore there is no contradiction between Matthew and Acts re Judas death MY REPLY we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records his death Although it s possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging and hit some rocks thereby bursting open I can no longer assume that to be the case Therefore no contradiction Matthew did not say Judas died as a result of the hanging did he Most scholars believe he probably did but ______________________________________________________________________ I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars explanations but in looking at the texts initially we can t assume Judas died It is however highly probable DB By the way while all agree that Judas died from the hanging the books had different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing One simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew s version as the correct version in both Matt and Acts The Biblical Knowledge Commentary suggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted his belly exploded which doesn t explain his headlong fall or that his branch or rope broke and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out which doesn t explain how a hanging man would fall headlong rather than feet first MY REPLY The outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors how high the person was suspended before the fall any obstructions such as tree branches that may have deviated the fall how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell upon thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks etc In a superficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage we are not given a lot of info on the geographical specifics but Tony in the above quoted post gave us some _____________________________________________________________________ A possible reconstruction would be this Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom After he hung there for some time the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge mangling his body in the process The fall could have been before or after death as either would fit this explanation This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom is examined From the bottom of the valley you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom Therefore it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down tearing his body open _____________________________________________________________________ DB Now truthfully I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the source of the Potter s field prophesy but on the other hand the author is correct Matthew does make that confusion Of course a Biblical inerrantist who claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God will have to thereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas ie where the prophesy of the Potter s field came from MY REPLY Please when we are done with this study on his death remind me to discuss this with you DB As to your second question Mr DeCenso you ask how we could be sure that the money with which Judas purchased the land was indeed for the betrayal rather than some other source I would point out that in Acts where it specifically mention the reward of iniquity Acts 1 18 it also specifically mentions what act of iniquity they were talking about ie Acts 1 16 concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus Now I would point out that when the Bible describes an act of iniquity and then immediately discusses the reward of iniquity it would be rather inane to suggest that it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed MY REPLY Dave we are getting somewhere aren t we ACT 1 15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty and said ACT 1 16 Men and brethren this Scripture had to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus ACT 1 17 for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry ACT 1 18 Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out ACT 1 19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem so that field is called in their own language Akel Dama that is Field of Blood ACT 1 20 For it is written in the book of Psalms Let his dwelling place be desolate And let no one live in it and Let another take his office Notice that in verse 16 the word iniquity is not used Rather it states that Judas became a guide to those who arrested Jesus But the writer DID NOT stop there vs 17 for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry What part did Judas play in their ministry JOH 12 6 This he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the money box and he used to take what was put in it JOH 13 29 For some thought because Judas had the money box that Jesus had said to him Buy those things we need for the feast or that he should give something to the poor So now we know what part Judas played he was a treasurer per se Right after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry treasurer according to John THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of wages of iniquity money that should have been put into the ministry but was stolen by Judas to purchase a field I believe this is a better exegetical explanation of what the wages of iniquity are What do you think Dave DB Now since I have given you clear answers and even references perhaps you could unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are instead of asking me what type I think you are as you did to Mr Joslin MY REPLY I will gladly admit that I am a Complete Inerrantist although I do not have that big a problem with the Limited Inerrancy view Frank If one wished to contend with Him he could not answer Him one time

write this that the ATF has ignited all the buildings of the Branch Dividian ranch near Waco TX The lies from ATF say holes were made in the walls and non lethal tear gas pumped in A few minutes after this started the whole thing went up ALL buildings are aflame NO ONE HAS ESCAPED I think it obvious that the ATF used armored flame thrower vehicles to pump in unlit napalm then let the wood stove inside ignite it Actually if a few minutes translates into 6 hours you have it right BUT you and I guess your single source news agency CNN failed to mention the Davidians pouring kerosene all over and lighting it in plain view THIS IS MURDER Well small scale Jim Jones type suicide with fire instead of kool aid ATF MURDERERS BUTCHERS Sorry guy you got it wrong ATF was pumping tear gas into the compound The Branch Davidians going along with their apocolyptic faith set their own compound on fire killing all but 9 or so No children survived THIS IS GENOCIDAL MASS SLAUGHTER OF INNOCENT PEOPLE

patients read package inserts PDR Reply To Gordon Banks Organization Univ of Pittsburgh Computer Science Lines 48 In article Ruth Ginzberg writes Hmmmm here s one place where I really think the patient ought to take more responsibility for him or herself There is absolutely no reason why you can t ask the pharmacist filling the prescription for the Physicians Package Insert for the medication when you pick it up at the pharmacy Make sure to tell the pharmacist that you want the Physicians Package Insert NOT the If people are going to do this I really wish they would tell me first I d be happy to go over the insert in the PDR with them and explain everything All too many patients read the insert and panic and then on the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug and we are starting over again at square one Some of them probably didn t even come back for followup because they didn t want to admit they wouldn t take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or something What people don t understand about the inserts is that they report every adverse side effect ever reported without substantiating that the drug was responsible The insert is a legal document to slough liability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to happen If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information on a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the AMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific There are very few drugs that someone hasn t reported a death from taking Patients don t realize that and don t usually appreciate the risks to themselves properly I m sure Herman is going to go ballistic but so be it Another problem is that probably most drugs have been reported to cause impotence Half the males who read that will falsely assume it could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will refuse to take any drug like that This can be a real problem for PDR readers There needs to be some way of providing patients with tools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need I am involved in a research project to do that with migraine as the domain It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions about migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient For common illnesses such as migraine and hypertension this may help quite a bit The patient could spend as much time as needed with the computer and this would then not burden the physician Clearly physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked things that the patients should have found out from their physician but didn t Why they didn t isn t

racist I don t think this same reason applies to Somalia at all The whole point is that Somalia _is_ a third world country and we were more willing to send troops there than to Bosnia exactly the _opposite_ of what the fixation on European countries theory would predict Similarly the desire to help Muslims being fought by Christians is also exactly the opposite of what that theory predicts For that matter this theory of yours suggests that Americans should want to help the Serbs After all they re Christian and the Muslims are not If the desire to intervene in Bosnia is based on racism

see people sending out press releases help Bosnian Serbs with ethnic cleansing The Muslim presence in the Balkans should be eliminated now Well except for some Serbs but I admit that the desire of

sides are equal True it may sometimes be difficult or impossible to determine which side is the victim but that does not mean that victims do not exist Yes victims exist There are a staggering number of victims in the world and more each day I think on balance intervention would create more victims including American ones Since the first responsibility of the US government is to protect Americans I think they serve that role best by staying away from Bosnia and other regional conflicts Would you in WWII have said that there were atrocities on the sides of both the Jews and the Germans Of course not The Jews were not trying to carve a territory out of Germany either and except for small scale resistance and a few larger uprisings did not have an army or a government These people have been butchering each other for centuries When one side wins and gets what it wants it will stop Yes but both sides want different things The Muslims chiefly want to not be ethnic cleansed The Serbians want to ethnic cleanse the Muslims It is indeed true that each side will stop when it gets what it wants but the things that the two sides want are not equivalent I see the pattern of atrocities as a fairly often practiced tactic of a colonizing power driving away and or eliminating the population of an area they want to control The US tried basically that in Vietnam the Iraqis in Kuwait the Israelis in Palestine South Africa etc etc etc It sucks it s ugly and it s saddening But it is not genocide It is not my impression that the Serbs want to eliminate every Muslim in Yugoslavia I still

mess in the world 2 Clinton is not the man to lead this country into a military adventure Full stop 3 It is by no means clear what intervention would accomplish nor that it would necessarily help the

Artificial Intelligence Lab Lines 996 NNTP Posting Host life ai mit edu THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary _____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 14 1993 PRESS BRIEFING BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS The Briefing Room 12 40 P M EDT MR STEPHANOPOULOS I guess I m just prepared to take questions today Q George Bob Dole says that the Clinton administration s policy on Bosnia is a failure and that he wants the United States to take the lead in lifting the arms embargo so that the Bosnian Muslims can defend themselves MR STEPHANOPOULOS As you know President Clinton has said that that suggestion is under active consideration Obviously this is a tragic situation in Bosnia And if the Bosnian Serbs don t come to the negotiating table in a constructive way we ll look seriously at pressing for lifting the arms embargo In the meantime we re going to continue to press for a tough sanctions resolution in the U N We re going to continue to work on the Serbs to come to the negotiating table But the prospect of an arms embargo is something the President certainly will consider if the Serbs don t come to the table Q How much longer are you going to give them to come to the table George MR STEPHANOPOULOS We re working on that right now Q It s been a long time Q On February 19th the President mentioned the value added tax in Ohio And when he was asked about it later by reporters he said quote That is a radical change in the tax system of the United States It s something I think we may have to look at in the years ahead Questioned again about it later he says It is not something that is now under consideration If we start considering it I ll tell you It wasn t a trial balloon or anything he said I was just discussing the tax response to a question Donna Shalala quoted in USA Today this morning quote Certainly we re looking at a VAT What s gone on Q The same with Alice Rivlin this morning MR STEPHANOPOULOS The health care task force is reviewing a number of options They haven t made any decisions yet And as I have said from this podium time and time again we re not going to comment on decisions that haven t been made Q But you have also said from this podium time and time again Q Wait a minute Whoa Nelly Whoa Q that that was not under consideration Q Yes Clinton says It is not something that is now under consideration Is that no longer true MR STEPHANOPOULOS I believe the working group as Ms Shalala says has looked at this prospect but no decisions have been made of any kind Q Well I know But he said he d tell us about it if it was ever under consideration I take it that now he is and he didn t tell us about it or MR STEPHANOPOULOS Did he say if it was under consideration or if it was something to be proposed Q If we start considering I ll tell you MR STEPHANOPOULOS If it s something to be proposed Q If we start considering it I ll tell you That s a direct quote MR STEPHANOPOULOS The task force has looked at a number of different options They have not made any decisions yet The President has not made any decisions yet This is one of the proposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and cast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform the health care system They have cast a very wide net They have looked at hundreds of different proposals probably thousands of different proposals But the President has not made any decisions Q Well is the President aware of their consideration of this option MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know if he s been briefed on any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task force on this specific proposal of any kind I don t know that that s gotten to his level He started yesterday to go through with the task force a very wide range of decisions and I don t believe that that s been presented to him no Q Well he s not relying on the USA Today to tell him what his task force is considering in the way of taxes MR STEPHANOPOULOS No he s going through it in a very deliberate fashion There are a number of decisions that have to be made I don t know that this proposal has reached that decision making point Q If this is still under consideration that s a change at least from what we ve been told by Dee Dee I think about three weeks ago or so She said that is not an option talking about the had a big argument with somebody over this so I remember it specifically and said it not once but twice Is that not the case MR STEPHANOPOULOS Again I don t know if this has been presented to the President as something that is being looked at at some level in the task force Q It was ruled it out though I mean unlike other options that you ve kept in the mix this one specifically was ruled out MR STEPHANOPOULOS Again this is something that is being looked at but no decision has been made of any kind I mean it doesn t it s not necessarily material until you get to the decision making phase The working groups are looking at hundreds of different options Q If it was ruled out before and it s not ruled out now then something has changed George Yes no Q When a guy says in February MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well the working groups are looking at the widest possible range of options Q So something s changed They weren t looking at it before they re looking at it now MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well I don t know if the working groups have gotten to that point yet They are casting a very wide net Q How was it possible that you and Dee Dee were able to sell definitively rule it out as an option previously and now are saying that in fact it is being considered MR STEPHANOPOULOS Again the working groups are looking at a wide range of options They have not Q Do you deny that you and Dee Dee ruled it flatly ruled it out on several occasions in the past month MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t deny that I mean those are the President s words Those are very clear Q Subsequent to the President s words do you deny that within the last month you and Dee Dee have both publicly ruled it out MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know about the timing I think what we did was refer back to the President s words and say they stand Q So don t they stand any longer Q March 25th Clinton said for the next four to five years it was ruled out MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well those words the President did say that in February The working groups are on a separate track and as I said I don t believe Q Separate from the President MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t believe this has been presented to the President Q Are they considering something that the President Q Has ruled out Q has ruled out I mean will the President consider a VAT tax MR STEPHANOPOULOS Again the working groups have not presented this to the President They have looked at a wide range of options I suppose that if an argument is made he will clearly listen to it That does not mean he has decided to do it Q Can we put this another way In his answer in Ohio he looked at the VAT in terms of restructuring the whole tax system Under those that was the circumstance that he said it might be considered at some future point Is that no longer the case or is that the only way that he can see a VAT emerging MR STEPHANOPOULOS I guess I m not sure exactly what you re asking Q He talked about the VAT in the context of a restructured tax system not as a specific way to finance health care for example Q Or anything else Q Or anything else Q It was always in the context of substituting for other taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system MR STEPHANOPOULOS Right Q Has that change too Q Is that still his view MR STEPHANOPOULOS I haven t spoken about those specific comments I think I can just go back to it are the working groups have they examined the possibility of a VAT Yes they have Q Certainly we re looking at a VAT she said MR STEPHANOPOULOS They have examined the possibility of a VAT Has it been presented to the President Has he made a decision No he has not Q What kind of a deal do you have when you ve got the President s appointed task force obviously not oblivious to his ruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line reform goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has specifically ruled out in any context other than much later and then goes ahead and announces that that s what they re looking at Is the President concerned about that sort of thing MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think that the President s concern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal possible He s concerned with making sure that they have the most thorough process for examining all the possible alternatives all the different alternatives If a decision is made to go forward with something like that it s certainly something the President will explain and justify But no decision has been made along those lines Q What does it mean exactly though when the President rules something out Does it mean it can get back on the table later if a more persuasive argument is made MR STEPHANOPOULOS That s just that s indisputably true If you but at the same time he has not ruled it in He has not made a proposal Q What makes him open to it now when he wasn t open to it before MR STEPHANOPOULOS He s certainly willing to listen to the argument Q Was he willing to listen to the argument for a short term tax this year and he wasn t willing to listen to it in Chilicothe He s now open to it MR STEPHANOPOULOS The context of his comments was that it was not something he wanted to be clear that this is not something he was proposing not something he was floating Q Not something he was considering Those are his words It s not something that s now under consideration If we start considering it I ll tell you You re now acknowledging are you not that it is under consideration and MR STEPHANOPOULOS I m acknowledging that the task force has studied this proposal I am also stating that the President has not made a decision on it Q But the door is open for the President to reconsider including this as part of MR STEPHANOPOULOS Obviously the working groups are looking at it Again but the President has not made a decision Q Do you know if they will make a presentation on behalf of the VAT to him MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know that I assume that if I don t know what stage they are it in proposing I don t know that they re going to make the conclusion that this is something they should present to him I know this is something the working groups are looking at Q Do you understand George that none of us are asking these questions in context of a decision that the President has made only about what the President is considering MR STEPHANOPOULOS I understand that and I am acknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a VAT Q And the President will consider it MR STEPHANOPOULOS I assume that he will consider the argument if it is presented to him Q Does that mean the President that working groups think that when the President says no he means maybe Laughter MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think that means that the working groups are trying to do the most thorough job possible Q George can I ask you another question about Bosnia MR STEPHANOPOULOS Sure Laughter Q No he wants us to stay on this Q Let s do gays in the military Laughter Q No he got out of that swamp Q I think we ve gotten the bottom line on that VAT Reggie Bartholomew your Special Ambassador in Belgrade today said that if the Serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked out quote We will do our part to pursue the lifting of the arms embargo together with our allies That seems to go a bit further than what you ve just said MR STEPHANOPOULOS Sounds almost exactly what I just said Q Well do you accept in other words you accept what Reggie MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well the President has said that this is something that s under consideration It is something he will consider if the current actions don t bring the Serbs to the table Q Isn t there some kind of timetable here MR STEPHANOPOULOS Yes there is a timetable There s going to be a vote on the U N resolution in about 10 days Q That s on sanctions that s on tightening the sanctions MR STEPHANOPOULOS That s right that s sanctions And we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure and we hope that that will bring the Serbs to the table As you know Mr Bartholomew also met with Mr Churkin of Russia and they are also working on ways to bring the Serbs to the table We will continue to pressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option as well Q The question is whether there s a timetable for consideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo not the sanctions MR STEPHANOPOULOS The next vote in the U N is on sanctions As far as I know there are no votes scheduled on lifting the arms embargo But it is something that we have discussed both internally and with our allies Q Why did Reggie Bartholomew tell the Serbs that the U S would do that What was the point of his telling them that MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well clearly I mean this is something that s under consideration and this is something that we take quite seriously if they do not come to the table They should know the consequences of failing to come to the table Q Have they been given a deadline Q Warren Christopher has been saying the same thing and it hasn t seemed to change the Serbs behavior in the least Why should the Serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo when so far everything that s been done has had no effect on the fighting in Bosnia MR STEPHANOPOULOS I just don t accept the premise of your question It has had an effect the embargo is having an effect Q What effect MR STEPHANOPOULOS If the Serbians choose not to heed our warnings then they will face the consequences Q What effect has it had in Bosnia MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well the effect that it has had on the Serbians it has tightened up they are not getting their shipments through We can brief more fully Q In Bosnia George In Bosnia what effect has it had MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well it s hard to say if it s stopped the aggression to date That is why we re continuing to press for the Serbians to stop But we believe that over time we will continue to weaken the Serbs and that will have an effect I m not saying it s going to happen overnight it clearly hasn t happened overnight But we believe that over time the sanctions can weaken the Serbs If it fails to work and if the Serbs fail to come to the negotiating table we ll move forward with the embargo Q Isn t there a working deadline George of the 24th the same date as the U N the scheduled U N vote Hasn t the United States said along with many of the other NATO allies that if the Serbs aren t willing to sign on to the peace accord by then that we ll seek haven t we said that we will seek MR STEPHANOPOULOS We ve said continually we re going to Q But on that deadline MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t have a specific date but we re going to move forward with the resolution the U N resolution by around that time And if that fails to take effect if that fails to bring the Serbs to the table we will clearly consider other actions Q Isn t this awfully incremental MR STEPHANOPOULOS We re taking a step by step approach We re ratcheting up the pressure and we re going to continue to do that Q Is there a possibility George that by the time all these incremental steps are taken the Serbs will have achieved their goals and then what s the purpose MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think the purpose is to get the Serbs to stop the aggression We are pursuing that goal on many different fronts We are pursuing it through the U N we re pursuing it through direct talks we are pursuing it through tightening the sanctions And we will consider lifting the arms embargo We are turning the screws up on the Serbs and we will continue to do that Q But if the efforts have been unsuccessful in getting the Serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any campaign be to have the Serbs give back what they ve gained I mean once they re entrenched MR STEPHANOPOULOS I can t speculate on that We re going to continue to press for them to come to the table now We re going to continue to find ways to stop the aggression But I can t see into the future Q George on the stimulus package House Republicans say they re going to hold a series of town meetings on Saturday to try and explain the details of your package They cite polls which show that the more people learn about it the less they like it What s your strategy to counter that MR STEPHANOPOULOS The strategy we have is the one we re going to continue As you saw the President today pointed up the very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package will provide 700 000 new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner cities and suburbs to do productive work We are also going to point out the benefits of the highway money the investments in highways We re going to point up the benefits of immunization We re going to point up the benefits of Head Start We are going to say that the Republicans have a choice they can take action to create jobs or they can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years Q Does it concern you though that the House now the House Republicans are after you as well as the Senate MR STEPHANOPOULOS The House Republicans voted against it before They made a mistake then they re making a mistake now Q George does it strike anybody in the administration that it s a bit strong to describe as the President did this morning the summer jobs program as quote a reaffirmation of a promise of America MR STEPHANOPOULOS Not at all I think it s the promise of America to give kids a chance to reach their full potential Q Government funded jobs MR STEPHANOPOULOS To give people a chance to work Absolutely That is the promise of America Q I want to follow up on something I asked yesterday where does 700 000 summer jobs where does that figure come from MR STEPHANOPOULOS That is on top of I did look at it There are currently 600 000 summer jobs in the pipeline This will be on top of the 600 000 so it will be a total of 1 3 million Q The 700 000 would be created by the stimulus package MR STEPHANOPOULOS Yes Q Where does that number come from Because we ve been told all along that the stimulus package would create 500 000 new jobs And according to Panetta that breaks down to something like 200 000 full time jobs and 150 000 summer jobs MR STEPHANOPOULOS Yes but the summer that s when you do their full time equivalence I mean 700 000 individuals will receive jobs this summer When you calculate it for the full time job effect you have to do I don t know what the exact formula is Q Seven hundred thousand part time jobs MR STEPHANOPOULOS 150 000 or Q One to four because it s three months MR STEPHANOPOULOS Thank you Q Can I follow up on that Did the President misspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money for these summer jobs will pay for private for kids to work in the private sector MR STEPHANOPOULOS Not necessarily I mean I think that there will be grants available That s one of the ways that you pay for the jobs At the same time he s also issued a challenge to the private sector to hire kids on their own as well Q Tax dollars for instance would pay for kids to work at Time Warner MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think the Time Warner is actually somebody coming forward and actually doing a grant That s going to be the bulk of it There could be isolated instances though where there would be grants to businesses Q Has the President spoken with any Senate Republicans this week MR STEPHANOPOULOS No but there s been a lot of contact with Senate Republicans in the White House Q At a lower level But the President hasn t MR STEPHANOPOULOS The President has not no Q Getting any closer to get the votes MR STEPHANOPOULOS We re continuing to work on it Q Anybody leaning your way Q On Haiti The New York Times seems to be reporting something of a breakthrough in Aristide s attitude towards the coup leaders Can you confirm that there has been this change and what impact will it have on the process And what did Pezzullo have to say yesterday in his report MR STEPHANOPOULOS Pezzullo did brief the principals I can t confirm what s actually happening in the talks I would leave that to the negotiators themselves But Mr Caputo has returned to Haiti We have received a briefing here at the White House from Ambassador Pezzullo And as we have said time and time again we believe that assurances of security are important to a final resolution to a broader political settlement Q George yesterday you offered some selective breakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities Can we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be impacted MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think we have it for most states yes And I think we can get it out Q Could you make that generally available MR STEPHANOPOULOS I believe we can Q And could you do it by the component of the stimulus In other words MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know if we can do I know that we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs I don t know how deeply it can be broken down But clearly we can break it down into summer jobs and other jobs Q And can I follow up Is this the information that Jeff Eller and the rest of the White House is using in the ads in the states MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know if they re ads but they re press releases Q Can you describe what those press releases contain MR STEPHANOPOULOS All we re doing is pointing out the benefits of this package to various states For instance I know that today Senator Dole is heading up to Vermont and New Hampshire And I would point out that the stimulus package the jobs package creates 1 000 jobs in Vermont It creates 2 000 jobs in New Hampshire And the people of those states should remind him that this is important Q Where are the releases going MR STEPHANOPOULOS They go to the states Q To whom MR STEPHANOPOULOS We can get them It s no problem Q Can we get it Q Why don t you put them out here as well MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think we can Q This afternoon Would that be possible MR STEPHANOPOULOS I ll have to check I don t know But as soon as we can Q Are you focusing these press releases on states where there are moderate or pragmatic Republican senators MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think we re trying to get as many as we can It s actually quite difficult to pull this together and we re doing our best We re putting them out as we get them Q Why are you so closely tracking Senator Dole s schedule MR STEPHANOPOULOS I was just following it Q Are press releases going along to states where he s visiting MR STEPHANOPOULOS I m not sure I think that probably there are press releases going to Vermont Laughter Q Will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting Laughter Q George as the President goes about the business of defending what s in his stimulus package he doesn t address what seems to be the Republicans main point that you re funding it with deficit spending rather than if it s so important why not come up with the funding for it seems to be the Republican argument And how do you answer that MR STEPHANOPOULOS What was answer is we are paying for it over time And if you look at our budget we pay for this package over time We believe right now the economy needs a jump start for jobs Q You re not claiming are you that that doesn t add to the deficit this year MR STEPHANOPOULOS I m saying we re paying for it over time I didn t say that Q I know that George But I mean from the beginning the question we do have annual budgets and things deficit spending will pay for that this year will it not MR STEPHANOPOULOS This year they clearly will But over time our budget fully pays for this program Q What you re saying is that there are savings that would cover this if it were this year in future years MR STEPHANOPOULOS Absolutely That s exactly what I said Q I know that but there is going to be outstanding debt it will add to the national debt from this year MR STEPHANOPOULOS No we re reducing the deficit by 500 billion 514 billion over the next four years Q You mean you re reducing it below what it would have been MR STEPHANOPOULOS Exactly Q In fact you re adding a very large amount to the national debt over the period of MR STEPHANOPOULOS But we re reducing it far more from what it would have been That s true Q Washington type reduction Laughter Q You re getting to be a grumpy old man Q George has any decision been made about the White House or the President s participation in the gay rights march coming up in a week and a half MR STEPHANOPOULOS We re working on the President s schedule now I believe he s going to be at the Senate Democratic retreat in Jamestown that weekend Q Will he address it by phone MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know about that It s a little far out but I believe he s going to be in the Senate retreat Q So will he have the leaders in a day or two before the speech MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know I would expect that at some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups I don t know the schedule on it though Q Will there be an AIDS czar appointed prior to or in conjunction with the event MR STEPHANOPOULOS I m just not sure Q April 22nd is Earth Day What is the President going to do to mark that and is it the case that he is going to sign the biodiversity treaty that day MR STEPHANOPOULOS I know there s been some work on the biodiversity treaty I don t know about signing it that day but I would expect he ll have a statement on Earth Day or right around then Q Where is the work on the biodiversity treaty MR STEPHANOPOULOS I d have to check with Katie McGinty I just know that there s been some work done but I don t know exactly what Q When is Earth Day MR STEPHANOPOULOS The 22nd I think Q Why is it you know that he is going to have a statement on Earth Day but you don t know if he s going to have a statement on the gay rights march MR STEPHANOPOULOS I said I don t know if he s going to meet or when he s going to meet Q Do you have a statement on the gay rights march MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t actually no I wouldn t be surprised if he did though Q Do you have some details on the Miyazawa visit MR STEPHANOPOULOS It s a working visit on Friday and the President is looking forward to that in discussing a number of issues including Russian aid and the Japanese stimulus package and the trade issues between the two countries Q There was some expectations that a second aid package to Russia was going to be unveiled at the G 7 meeting and if I understand it hasn t happened Why is that or what s the status on that MR STEPHANOPOULOS The G 7 meeting is still going on and as you know Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher have talked about the outlines of a possible package But we re going to continue to consult with Congress and our G 7 allies on that Q We will not then make any kind of announcement during the two day meeting MR STEPHANOPOULOS The meeting s not over yet Q Is that when you re going to make one MR STEPHANOPOULOS I m not ruling out the possibility Q the President s going to announce it tomorrow Q Bentsen said that Q Yes Bentsen said it would be tomorrow Q So did Christopher MR STEPHANOPOULOS I d have to look at that but I believe it is more likely that the announcement will come out of Tokyo Q George has there been further consideration here about going to sending the President out to Los Angeles MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know that there s it s not something we ve ruled out We don t have a date set for it Q George you all have a position or do you support Immigration s plan to settle 4 000 Iraqi prisoners in the United States MR STEPHANOPOULOS It s the first I ve heard of it Q George there was a report today about the Q Fortunately Laughter Q about the pace of appointments and says that President Clinton is behind President Bush in the number of positions that people have been nominated for Are you going to speed up the pace of nominations or where do you stand with it MR STEPHANOPOULOS We filled 814 of the President s appointments And it s broken down we have 384 Schedule C 147 noncareer SES 213 PAS full time I m not sure what that means laughter 70 PA full time And this is about the same it s about the same pace of President Bush Obviously as you move along farther once you each level of appointment actually has a multiplier effect and frees up far more appointments So we expect the process to speed up But we re at the pace of Bush Obviously we d like to get these done as quickly as possible I would point out that the FBI background checks and the background check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time than our predecessors and that is part of the holdup But we re working on it Q Is that because of Nannygate MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think that s an awful big part of it yes Q In the story this morning you were at approximately the same pace as Bush in making appointments but way behind in winning confirmations MR STEPHANOPOULOS That s where the background checks comes into play That s the problem Q That s the background checks problem Because I mean you have a Democratic Senate MR STEPHANOPOULOS No that s not the you make the appointments and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all the forms and have the background checks done That s exactly where the problem is Q What s the President doing this afternoon and what s on the plan for tomorrow MR STEPHANOPOULOS He s got some meetings just office meetings this afternoon for the most part on a variety of issues that probably a half dozen different issues And then he ll be tomorrow we ll have an event probably again focused on the stimulus and jobs package out of here at the White House And Friday is the Miyazawa meeting Q Will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow George MR STEPHANOPOULOS Either tomorrow or Friday Q Is there going to be a pre briefing regarding the Japanese Prime Minister s visit tomorrow MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know about tomorrow but we ll probably get something done as we usually do for these visits Q Was Reverend Jackson here this morning and do you know what that was about MR STEPHANOPOULOS He was here He met with a group of us here at the White House including Mack McLarty Q Who Q Reverend Jackson MR STEPHANOPOULOS Reverend Jackson Mack McLarty me Gene Sperling Bruce Reed Jeff Watson Mark Gearan Q Talking about Haiti MR STEPHANOPOULOS We talked about general urban policy He is about to go to Los Angeles He was just back from Mississippi where we had a good victory last night and he s going on to Los Angeles Q Did he request the meeting MR STEPHANOPOULOS Actually no He s in continual contact with the President He had written a letter on a variety of issues and so we asked him to come in and talk about it Q George Dole is having a fundraiser for Jeffords tonight in Vermont Have you guys been in contact with Jeffords at all on this MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think there s been some contact sure Q Can you tell us about the contacts MR STEPHANOPOULOS I m not sure Q Do you know who contacted him or what was said MR STEPHANOPOULOS I know that Howard Paster talked to him and they just has a general talk about the package Q And did he express his support for it now or is he MR STEPHANOPOULOS I can t divulge the details of the conversation but there have been conversations Q The L A Times is reporting that abortion elective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care package Is this something the President is considering MR STEPHANOPOULOS Again Q Along with the VAT Laughter MR STEPHANOPOULOS It s certainly something that s been looked at but no decisions have been made Q What was the question MR STEPHANOPOULOS The L A Times story on whether abortions will be covered by the President s health plan Q Did the President in his meeting did you in your meeting with Reverend Jackson ask his advice solicit his advice about what kind of stance the White House should take in the wake of the verdict in L A MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well we certainly talked about the situation in Los Angeles and the long term prospects for economic development and other issues Q For instance did you discuss whether it would be helpful for the President to go there or not MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well we discussed a wide range of issues related to Los Angeles That was certainly one of them Q Letting you perhaps go out on the way you came in I need to go back to Bosnia just for a second and ask MR STEPHANOPOULOS Oh good Q your reaction to Margaret Thatcher s comments that you re just sitting by and watching a massacre MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well we ve been pushing very hard on a number of fronts for more aggressive action We will continue to do that Q Can you tell us if you ve made any progress in your talks on the stimulus package getting a compromise I mean we don t

Organization Technical University Braunschweig Germany Lines 114 In article writes Didn t you say Lucifer was created with a perfect nature Yes Define perfect then I think you are playing the usual game here make sweeping statements like omni holy or perfect and don t note that they mean exactly what they say And that says that you must not use this terms when it leads to contradictions I m not trying to play games here But I understand how it might seem that way especially when one is coming from a completely different point of view such as atheism Take your foot out of your mouth I wondered about that already when I was a Catholic Christian The fact that the contradiction is unresolvable is one of the reasons why I am an atheist Believe me I believed similar sentences for a long time But that shows the power of religion and not anything about its claims Now God could have prevented Lucifer s fall by taking away his ability to choose between moral alternatives worship God or worship himself but that would mean that God was in error to have make Lucifer or any being with free will in the first place Exactly God allows evil an evil if there ever was one Now that s an opinion or at best a premise But from my point of view it is not a premise which is necessary true specifically that it is an evil to allow evil to occur It follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used Letting evil happen or allowing evil to take place in this place even causing evil is another evil But could you give a definition of free will Especially in the presence of an omniscient being Will is self determination In other words God created conscious beings who have the ability to choose between moral choices independently of God All will therefore is free will The omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even before the omnipotent has created them There is no choice left All is known the course of events is fixed Not even for the omniscient itself to extend an argument by James Tims If God is omniscient then clearly creating beings with free moral choice is a greater good than the emergence of ungodliness evil sin since He created them knowing the outcome in advance Why is it the greater good to allow evil with the knowledge that it will happen Why not make a unipolar system with the possibility of doing good or not doing good but that does not necessarily imply doing evil It is logically possible but your god has not done it I do not know that such is logically possible If God restrains a free being s choice to choose to do evil and simply do not good then can it be said that the being truly has a free moral choice And if good is defined as loving and obeying God and avoiding those behaviors which God prohibits then how can you say that one who is not good is not evil as well Like I said I am not sure that doing not good without doing evil is logically possible And when I am not omnipotent how can I have free will You have said something about choices and the scenario gives them Therefore we have what you define as free will Imagine the following I can do good to other beings but I cannot harm them Easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good deeds but don t make them long for them so they can not feel the absence of good as evil But whose case am I arguing It is conceivable so the omnipotent can do it Or it would not be omnipotent If you want logically consistent as well you have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first Deletion Perhaps it is weak in a way If I were just speculating about the ubiquitous pink unicorns then there would be no basis for such speculation But this idea of God didn t just fall on me out of the blue or while reading science fiction or fantasy I know that some will disagree The Bible describes a God who is omniscient and nevertheless created beings with free moral choice from which the definitional logic follows But that s not all there is to it There seems to be at least in my mind a certain amount of evidence which indicates that God exists and that the Biblical description of Him may be a fair one It is that evidence which bolsters the argument in my view That the bible describes an omniscient and omnipotent god destroys the credibility of the bible nothing less And a lot of people would be interested in evidence for a god unfortunately there can t be any with these definitions Benedikt', 'From Brian Cash Subject Re A visit from the Jehovah s Witnesses Nntp Posting Host crchh410

is a new one to me I guess it s been a while since a Witness bothered with me Are they implying that Satan is omniscient You might try tricking them into saying that Satan is all knowing and then use that statement to show them how their beliefs are self contradictary No Satan is not omniscient but he does hold dominion over the earth according to Christian theology note not to be confused with JW s theology What are the standard theologies on who what created Satan and why Orthodox Christian theology states that God created Lucifer Satan along with the other angels presumably because He wanted beings to celebrate glorify existence and life and thereby God along with Him Actually the whys and wherefores of God s motivations for creating the angels are not a big issue within Christian theology But God created Lucifer with a perfect nature and gave him along with the other angels free moral will Lucifer was a high angel perhaps the highest with great authority It seems that his greatness caused him to begin to take pride in himself and desire to be equal to or greater than God He forgot his place as a created being He exalted himself above God and thereby evil and sin entered creation Actually the story goes that Lucifer refused to bow before MAN as God commanded him to Lucifer was devoted to God Oh yeah there is nothing in Genesis that says the snake was anything more than a snake well a talking one had legs at the time too I don t think pointing out contradictions in STORIES is the best way to show the error in theology if they think a supernatural entity

ra ways from the day that thou wast created till iniquity was found in ra thee Ezekiel 28 15 While Jesus is uncreated and the Creator of ra all things In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with ra God and the Word was God The same was in the beginning with God ra All things were made by him and without him was not any thing made ra that was made John 1 1 3 And he is before all things and by ra him all things consist Colossians 1 17 ra ra Your inference from the Ezekiel and John passages that Lucifer was ra created and that Jesus was not depends on a particular interpetation of ra the word create one with which many Christians may not agree ra Granted the Mormon belief that all of God s children including Christ ra and Lucifer are eternally existent intelligences which were organized ra into spirit children by God the term creation can apply equally well ra to both of those passages Just briefly on something that you mentioned in passing You refer to differing interpretations of create and say that many Christians may not agree So what That is really irrelevant We do not base our faith on how many people think one way or another do we The bottom line is truth regardless of popularity of opinions Also I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created and eternally existent are equivalent you say granted the Mormon belief You can t grant your conclusion and then expect the point to have been addressed In order to reply to the issue you have to address and answer the point that was raised and not just jump to the conclusion that you grant The Bible states that Lucifer was created The Bible states that Jesus is the creator of all The contradiction that we have is that the LDS belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same ra Your point that we all are brothers of Jesus and Lucifer is also ra heretical since we are not innately brothers and sisters of Christ ra We are adopted For ye have not received the spirit of bondage ra again to fear but ye have received the Spirit of adoption whereby ra we cry Abba Father Romans 8 15 and not the natural children ra of God It is only through faith that we even enter the family of ra God For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus ra Galatians 3 26 And it is only through the manifestation of this ra faith in receiving Jesus that we are become the sons of God But ra as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of ra God even to them that believe on his name Which were born not ra of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but ra of God John 1 12 13 ra ra Has it occured to you Robert that being born of someone or being ra of that person or Person s family may be a symbolic term in the New ra Testament Mormons believe that we are adopted into the House of ra Israel through baptism and faith in Christ although some have expressed ra belief that this does evince a physical change in our bodies The Mormon belief is that all are children of God Literally There is nothing symbolic about it This however contradicts what the Bible says The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God The field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one Matthew 13 38 I speak that which I have seen with my Father and ye do that which ye have seen with your father John 8 38 Ye do the deeds of your father Then said they to him We be not born of fornication we have one Father even God Jesus said unto them If God were your Father ye would love me for I proceeded

what the Bible teaches Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ Titus 2 13 Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ 2 Peter 1 1 on the Deity of Christ We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches To discount or not even address what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that have differing views is self defeating To see what the Bible teaches you have to look at the Bible ra Our Lord s mortality was essential to his own salvation _The ra Promised Messiah_ p 456 He had to work out his own salvation by ra doing the will of the Father in all things ibid p 54 he had ra to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom _Mormon ra Doctrine_ p 71 ra ra Welcome to the wonderful world of Mormon paradoctrine Robert The ra above books are by the late Bruce R McConkie a former general authority ra of the LDS Church Those books were not published by the Church nor do ra they constitute offical doctrine They consist of his opinions Now ra does that mean that what he says is

prepared to accept that I find this rather curious When I mentioned that the Mormon belief is that Jesus needed to be saved I put forward some quotes from the late apostle Bruce McConkie The curious part is that no one addressed the issue of Jesus needing to be saved Rick comes the closest with his I have my own conclusions to addressing the point Most of the other replies have instead hop scotched to the issue of Bruce McConkie and whether his views were official doctrine I don t think that it matters if McConkie s views were canon That is not the issue Were McConkie s writings indicative of Mormon belief on this subject is the real issue The indication from Rick is that they may certainly be Robert Weiss']"

Organization QNX Software Systems Ltd Lines 73 In article Blaise Cirelli writes So the question I have is HOW DANGEROUS IS RIDING Tough question more dangerous than driving a car and far more dangerous if you don t apply a modicum of intelligence to the activity Basically stupidity will get you hurt killed a lot faster on a motorcycle than in a car But with care it is not unreasonably dangerous Also buying good protective clothing is helpful that way if something does go wrong you are likely to be less severely injured First thing if possible take a MSF driver training course this will get you started on the right foot they teach control of the vehicle and safe riding practices Second buy protective gear At minimum a good helmet and a pair of leather gloves are a must A good sturdy piece of footgear is also very helpful though leather hiking boots a pair of old army boots or something similar works fine for this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay tied After those a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps are nice as well but these are also expensive items For the pants many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight Similarly for a jacket a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise though more people tend to have leather jackets around than pants Another thing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second hand leather jacket Look for a fairly thick leather in these items Third don t do anything stupid don t ride after drinking even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement and balance don t ride in the snow or when conditions are such that black ice is likely be very careful riding in the rain slow way down take corners gingerly brake early and gently try not to ride if you are sick tired taking any medication with drowsiness warnings or otherwise not in average shape With care you should be ok The next question I have is what bike would you recommend for a first time rider I don t want to race nor do I want to ride cross country nor do I want to ride on dirt trails I ll probably drive it on back roads with occasional rides on city streets and freeways The maximum I can spend is about 2500 so I ll be looking at a used bike I would suggest mid to late 80 s japanese mid sized standard Something in 400 650 cc range would probably be reasonable If you are shorter lighter than average you might want to go as low as a 300 400 cc bike Possible models The Suzuki GS series eg GS500 GS650 etc These are generally inline 4 bikes generally dependable except for a tendency to weakness in the charging system Stator and or Regulator Rectifier problems My first bike was a about 82 GS650 it server me well The Honda Nighthawk series this may also be known as the CB series I think eg Honda CB450 CB650 etc This is another series of standard motorcycles Also fairly dependable Kawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes but I don t know them as well For mid to late 80s models of the above you should be able to buy the bike for under 2000 leaving you money for protective clothing and insurance and licensing costs Hope this helps David', 'From Jerry

sucking structures AND why we observe orbital motion Ether the theoretical propogation media of electro magnetic waves was concluded not to exist based on the results of the Michelson Moreley experiment conducted a century ago I propose that those conclusions are flawed based on the fact that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the earth s surface not perpindicular Due to the prevailing assumption that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind The reversal of the that conclusion a pivotal keystone in the development of modern scientific thought could have ramifications of BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD REMEMBER Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge 1 I dream like this ether based reality The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality Creations start as a lattice placed into the ether Given a spin the lattices both drag the fluid like a margarita blender and ingest it converting it distilling localized mass time and energy non spinning lattice dark matter The earth isn t exactly spinning around the sun Picture an image of a galaxy we haven t any videos of them spinning Picture us being stationary and the sun s image being dragged across the sky by the spinning ether field Picture an onion each layer of which is spinning a little faster than the next A thread shot at the inner kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways its head being in a faster shell than its tail until it finally intersected the ground of the inner kernel its direction vector being straight down but its foot print being a line not a point sunrise sunset The moon isn t exactly orbiting us It is a parasite non self spin sustaining being dragged in the earth s ether field which is itself in the sun s much more powerful field Our seasons are the wobble of earth s axis like a top slowing down The orbit of the earth around the sun is all of the stars images being dragged around by the sun s ether feild The earth moon and sun are about the same size and distance apart Its just that the time between them varies greatly because the path is not the same The moon s lattice in the ether is like sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half turn The sun s lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has got the whole plate of noodles wound up The piece of light going to the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a j hook at the end The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the whole plate like a needle in a record before it gets there With a pencil compass and rule draw a diagram of how the moon can be about as big as earth s shadow upon it and at other times totally eclipse the sun Look in the sky except for your Knowledge would you guess that they are about the same size just because they look about the same size O E O O O S E M OR M _ _ S The full moon quarter moon etc is the difference between rate of ether spins What we are looking at is a rotating turntable view of the moon only half of which is facing the sun I ve seen a half moon within about 120 degrees of sky of the sun during the day Try and draw that earth shadow Its only the moon s image which appears to orbit us No matter where it is the light part is the part facing the sun and the dark part is the half facing away from the sun even when it appears to be behind us Light Years between galaxies is a misnomer The distance is closer to zero as time and matter are characteristics of this phase of reality which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion defining edge 0 ether spin What we are seeing could be essentially happening now The piece of light may have experienced many years but the trip could be very quick our time To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to de spin myself phase out my mass Good luck trying to design a propulsion system to drag around a space time locality its like trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within To find out about all of this I recommend studying history I d look in the book of life or holy grail etc Brain waves just might carry decipherable data I d start looking on some part of the spectra said to be unusable due to all the background noise 4 billion humans I d totally isolate myself record me thinking DOG backwards and learn to read what I got Microsoft Holy Grail card

hell and then die Warning about writing to the past I had a little dream of being in a world in the near parallel future lying along a path of history which we have diverged from There were twelve telepathic glowing beings who looked like an Oscar award and who had always been a dark one who looked like us and then myself The dark one was in the process of making the others into gods he had to teach them what that meant by advising them in their past Basically he manipulated them into reproducing and raising their children on his seed He said that the little ones who looked different were a sub species meant to provide service He carefully combed through history rewriting it in his favor pulling like a weed anything that compromised his control He enticed recruits by sending them his visions saying that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve souls kill or be killed The amount of control he could exert was finite though as at every change he made a void would appear in our reality The universe one day ended 100 meters from us it seemed odd but we couldn t remember how else it should be Then some of the twelve were no more Finally when he could prune no more and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips he stepped through his portal to the past to bask over and over in all that he had created I made a few more changes and lost my body existing only on the wind MORAL Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls whose will s are not in harmony with yours Golden Rule treat others as you wish to be treated I E you could end up along a

can make you a Prince or a Queen or you can live as a god in ancient Greece Go ahead repeat the third grade as often as you like Adam henry I Hope you like inspecting your socks Careful though if he likes your work but thinks you re getting wise he can direct you to cross paths with your old self and you ll vanish as you rewrite your own course of history none the wiser As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped back in time his hierarchy will lose its direction He can still make changes while he s here its just that that is work and with every adjustment this becomes less

of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate That guy is the master of illusion and the ultimate liar He tells it first and then just follows the thread of time in which the people are willing to buy it in which he can make it so He ll play a poker face up until he thinks he s cornered and then he ll whine beg and grovel All it means to him is that you re willing to live on the

solomon technet sg Lines 94 Government Mandated Energy Conservation is Unnecessary and Wastful Study Finds Washington DC The energy tax and subsidized energy efficiency measures supported by President Clinton and Energy Secretary Hazel O Leary are based on faulty assumptions a new study from the Cato Institute points out According to Jerry Taylor Cato s director of natural resource studies we are not running out of sources of energy The world now has almost 10 times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of 1970 Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as dramatically When standards of living population densities and industrial structures are controlled for the United States is no less energy efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group of Seven nations Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil price shocks because the energy economy is global Moreover since the cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the overall U S economy Market economies are on average 2 75 times more energy efficient per 1 000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies Utilities subsidized energy efficiency measurs known as demand side management programs encourage free riders overuse of competing resource inputs an competitive inequities Furthermore DSM programs do not reduce demand Taylor concludes that government mandated energy conservation imposes unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes not conserves energy that subsidizing energy conservation technologies will stymie not advance gains in energy conservation and that central control over the lifeblood of modern society energy would transfer

public policy research foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the traditional American principles of limited government individual liberty and peace To that end the Institute strives to achieve greater involvement of the intelligent concerned lay public in questions of policy and the proper role of government The Institute is named for Cato s Letters libertarian pamphlets that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation of the American Revolution Despite the achievement of the nation s Founders today virtually no aspect of life is free from government encroachment A pervasive intolerance for individual rights is shown by government s arbitrary intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for civil liberties To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy issues Books monographs and shorter studies are commissioned to examine the federal budget Social Security regulation military spending international trade and myriad other issues Major policy conferences are held throughout the year from which papers are published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal In order to maintain its

GOALS 2000 SATELLITE TOWN HALL MEETING Chamber of Commerce Building Washington D C 8 30 P M EDT SECRETARY RILEY Good evening and welcome to all of you in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April You know today is April 13th In 1743 Thomas Jefferson was born 250 years ago I think that s appropriate to mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he has been of course a person who has been one that we ve all followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education here in this great country The success of our democracy according to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational system His philosophy of government his belief in the importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest here this evening Tonight we re so pleased to have with us President Clinton He s come over from the White House to join us in the Chamber of Commerce studios Mr President it s good to have you We thank you for taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite network and we welcome you here this evening Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich And Bob it s certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening also I have some questions for our two guests and I m sure many of you do too So please call us if there s something that you d like to ask The number is 1 800 368 5781 or 5782 In Washington D C the number is 202 463 3170 or 3171 I believe the President has a few words that he might want to share with us And Mr President I ll ask you to do that at this time It s great to have you THE PRESIDENT Thank you very much Mr Secretary I m glad to be here with my friends Dick Riley and Bob Reich also members of my Cabinet at the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making along with its Center for Work Force Preparation to help to examine tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people from school to the work place I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts recognizing that without an educated work force we can t grow this economy or remain competitive and recognizing that we all have to work together business and government labor and educators to make things happen This satellite town meeting is a good example of that kind of working together And if you ll forgive me a little home state pride I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal Mart Corporation headquartered in Bentonville Arkansas for providing several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight I appreciate that a lot as well as the sites that are provided for all the rest of you I have tried as hard as I could to move toward constructive change for this country Secretary Riley talked about this being Thomas Jefferson s 250th birthday If Thomas Jefferson believed in anything he believed in these three things first in education second in real personal liberty freedom of religion freedom of speech freedom of association freedom of the press and third in the absolute imperative of changing as times change If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this beautiful city which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful cherry blossoms you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change with changing times For us here in America that means reducing our deficit and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we can compete in the world We re here to talk about that tonight about what we can do to educate and train our people better Unless we do that none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in government even to bring the budget into balance even to increase our investment in other things which will grow jobs will last in the long run We also have to have people who can carry their load And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven or eight times in a lifetime that begins with the education system and continues into the work force where education must go on for a lifetime It s not just important what you know but what you can learn And if I might I d like to close just by emphasizing we re doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the private sector to build a good school to work transition And we re trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that would create more than 700 000 new summer jobs including many thousands that have a strong education component so our young people can be learning and working at the same time Dick I think I ought to stop there That s a good place we can begin I think the discussion SECRETARY RILEY Thank you so much Mr President Each month we get together and talk about ways that all citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals And tonight we ll focus on goal five and how communities such as yours can prepare students for this world of work This week the Education Department and the Labor Department are hosting a conference here in Washington D C called Summer Challenge a program of work and learning to America s youth The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton s proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally enriched jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged areas of the country Mr President let s talk a minute you alluded to it somewhat about the Summer Youth Challenge Your program calls for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs And why in your words is that so important THE PRESIDENT I think it s important for two reasons First of all a lot of the young people we re trying to reach may have had trouble adjusting to school and learning And while we want them to have a good experience with a real job we also want them to continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year over the summertime And that is a very unproductive thing for schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already taught before Secondly we want to help these young people progress not only in terms of work but in terms of learning We want to abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is learning because we think that the best and most productive workers will have to be lifetime learners And we think that this experience could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to succeed in school or at work or in college as they go on SECRETARY RILEY Well I think the fact that these are disadvantaged kids that gap that lag you mentioned as they go into the next year is really even greater Secretary Reich of course you have training programs throughout the year And I wonder is you have any comment about this educational component of training SECRETARY REICH Well what we ve learned Mr Secretary is that for many young people whether it s for the summer or for the year actually on the job work experience combined with education is one of the best ways of learning Many young people for example have a lot they have a difficult time learning geometry But when they actually are there building something or working on something and they can see the exact and direct application of geometry they understand what it s used for And a lot of young people just that sense of connection between education and the world of work is terribly terribly important It s important during the summer but it s important for a lot of young people even beyond the summer SECRETARY RILEY Thank you Mr President you ve called for a youth apprenticeship program school to work transition And I wonder if you would tell us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it developing THE PRESIDENT Well first of all let s talk about why it s important Most new jobs that will be created in this decade will not require a four year college degree but most of them will require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people get in a high school diploma If you look at the last 10 years the average salaries of young people that had at least two years of good post high school education was a good salary that went up over the decade The young people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not go up and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade because they weren t productive they weren t more valuable to their employers So we think America has a big economic interest in trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school but don t go on to college make a transition to work which includes two years of further training either in a community college a vocational setting or perhaps on the job And what I have done in this budget as you know is to give you and Secretary Reich some funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states and with the private sector to build these programs state by state in a way that would be customized essentially by the business community based on the needs of the economy in any given area It could revolutionize long term the quality of the American work force and the earnings of American workers SECRETARY REICH I should add Mr President I think you know this from your experience in Arkansas and many of the people watching this program that the business community and educators labor groups are already in many of our communities many of our states building a school to work transition program In fact there s an awful lot of ferment a lot of excitement The people watching this program probably are the ones who are most directly involved in that And more power to them Secretary Riley and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes already out there SECRETARY RILEY Bob we re going to be talking tonight about youth apprenticeship and tech prep the co op learning career academies And what features all those programs that deal with this subject what are some of the features that every one of these school to work programs might have that are important SECRETARY REICH Well one thing that we ve seen and you and I have been working at this for a long time and you much longer than I we ve seen that active involvement of the business community is absolutely essential And I m so delighted that we re doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce The Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these kinds of programs training education retraining and we ve aimed to work very closely with the Chamber The business community is going to be actively engaged in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and helping the educators community colleges technical institutions develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future Communities have got to come together I mean this is one of the most important things You ve got to have all of these players in a community come together and work together and cooperate together You know too often we have the educators over here and the business leaders over here labor groups over here and everybody is talking but they re not really working together in a common strategy And the third and final ingredient I would say Dick would be a commitment to excellence a commitment both to academic excellence and also to skills development excellence This is not a tracking program we re talking about for kids who are not going to make it This is a program that every young person ought to be eligible for If they want to go on beyond that to four year college that s fine That ought to be permissible But we re talking about the foundation of learning about jobs the foundation skills for on the job learning And again those are the critical components It s already being done THE PRESIDENT I think if I might just interject one point based on my personal experience at home the business community has a critical role to play not simply in saying here are the job skills that are needed and here s what ought to be taught but also in monitoring that excellence If you have the right sort of partnership there the people who are paying the taxes and who are going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the second rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and influence them So I think that s very important And when we try to if you will fill in the blanks at the federal level trying to set some standards and provide some funds one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the quality of these programs because that s really what s going to determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile SECRETARY RILEY That s great We ve been talking of course about school to work and also the jobs and economic recovery program for this summer and fall But let s talk just a moment about long term school reform It s something especially close to me Mr President I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be coming forth before too long THE PRESIDENT Well as you know back when you and I were both governors we spent a lot of time working on our public schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals that the governors drafted along with representatives of President Bush s administration back in 1989 And what we re going to try to do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in Congress that will actually define the things that the national government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the children of this country and the adult learners too meet those goals making sure that when by 2000 people show up for school ready to learn that we get a 90 percent on time high school graduation rate that children at the 4th 8th and 12th grades are confident in the subjects they re supposed to know that they are second to none in math and science that are schools are safe disciplined and drug free And of course the fifth goal I took them out of line to say this the last is that we have a system of life long learning in this country And each one of those goals there s a national role a state role a school role school district role and a private sector role And what you ve attempted to do in this bill you re going to introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job is and seeing whether we re actually meeting the standards of quality that we need to meet It s very exciting So far as I know nothing quite like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their money but actually setting up a framework for excellence and partnerships so that we can do our job I m really excited about it SECRETARY RILEY Well I am too And I think really it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms of its relationship with states serving as a partner really to support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform efforts all driven by high standards That s the point Bob let me ask you one question and then we ll get to the telephone calls It s about the same subject We have of course skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000 and I wonder if you would comment on that SECRETARY REICH Well you know we have 75 percent of our young people who don t graduate from college Very often they don t have very many alternatives They do have a wonderful system of community colleges and technical institutions but if we had national skill standards to which they could aspire and which employers would understand as a national credential many of these young people would actually find that they were much more eligible for jobs Everybody doesn t have to go to college Other countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to college but you have a whole level of people who have certain technical preprofessional skills We can do it in this country If you don t go to four year college you re not a loser And we want to develop those national skill standards We re going to be working with the states with the Education Department with a lot of private industry in developing those standards And I think they will be the kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other institutions to rally around as well as our business community SECRETARY RILEY Well that s great Why don t we go ahead and go to the telephone We have a call I see Mayor Bruce Todd of Austin Texas Q Yes Mr President and Mr Secretary Reich and Riley we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today We have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who have heard what you have said and are very appreciative Let me simply say amen to some of the comments made already We agree with much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken and are very supportive We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our summer employment program over the last four years We expect to have over 2 000 employed this year in the summertime perhaps as much as 3 500 with the federal assistance Much of the question that we had designed you have answered in your opening comments so we must be thinking alike But the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day would be appropriate We know summertime is important Year round is even more important And what kind of initiatives at the federal level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year round basis And perhaps more importantly how can families and the local community be more involved using the federal initiative That s something that we believe is very important to success in this effort SECRETARY RILEY Mr President THE PRESIDENT I think I ll give everybody a chance to answer the question Bruce but let me first thank you for calling and thank you for all the great work that you re doing in Austin I ve seen some of it and I ve always been very impressed First with regard to the summer program we hope we can structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer program and that will move a lot of these young people back into schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in the private sector too We hope that Secretary Reich is going to try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer And we re working on that Secondly in the program that I have presented to the Congress over the next five years what we are attempting to do is to build in an amount of investment that s quite substantial for job training programs for school to work programs all of which give heavy heavy weight to local community input just the question you asked but do provide some federal investment dollars which we hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being trained on a year round basis And I will say again to echo what Secretary Reich said a moment ago to try to break down the barrier between what is seen as work and what is seen as learning An awful lot of young people actually have quite high IQs but actually learn so much better when they re doing than when they re reading or just listening So we hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent and we hope that if the whole budget passes and we do have 200 budget cuts and more than 200 actually in the budget and some revenue raisers and some new money for education and training that we ll be able to do just what you seem to want based on your question Bob do you want to say anything SECRETARY REICH Well you took most of the words out of my mouth Mr President as usual But let me just add one thing and that is that one of the most important aspects of post high school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college in addition to the school to work program simply is the availability of jobs And we ve got to get this economy moving again obviously It s terribly important to get this recovery program to get the economy back on track That s sort of the prerequisite to everything else If we don t get the economy back on track we have I think this is the 16th correct me if I m wrong Mr President I think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or greater This is a jobless recovery A lot of those kids are going to be getting out of school in June And even if we did everything right they would have a very very hard time getting jobs SECRETARY RILEY Thank you both Of course Goals 2000 will be a permanent long term thing that will certainly reach into next year It will involve if passed and we certainly hope it will be action plans with every state where we can be working together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways And then the state with all the various school districts a very important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement And I think everybody will see a great energy out there once we get that moving The next call is Dr Harry Heinemann New York Doctor Q Good evening Mr Secretary It is a pleasure to be on with you this evening As you may know bridging the school and work has been central to La Guardia s educational program since its inception in the 1970s and that includes the college the two alternative high schools that operate on our campus and the linkages we have forged with the local schools We have found this to be an extremely effective learning strategy And over the years we ve come to believe that there are several principles that are very important in bridging the school and work And these include integrating theory in the classroom with practice in the workplace with providing all students early exposure to careers as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills and lastly the critical role of the liberal arts particularly in the development of high performance competencies My question then is How can the general education faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with transition to work experience And what mechanisms and strategies can you suggest to achieve this integration SECRETARY RILEY Well thank you very much I think and we ll get a response from you all on that and very interesting work going on there We re going to have three people our next guests on the program this evening that will be some specialists in that area that you re speaking and I ll certainly pass that on to them and we can discuss it later You all care to comment any comments you might have THE PRESIDENT I d just like to say if I might one thing I want to reemphasize this and I don t think I m being as clear about it as I d like although I think at least one of the people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more explicitly than I I think this whole concept of applied academics is very important And I think that we have to basically abolish what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is vocational learning and what is academic learning I think we should keep the liberal arts going I think we should have a strong component for people who are in the vocational program SECRETARY REICH It seems to me that we also need to rethink our entire tracking system because a lot of these school and work combinations are important for mainstream students They re important for all students It s not just a special group of students that needs them Some of the experiments that I ve seen around the United States Dick I m sure you ve seen them as well are mainstream experiments They re mainstreaming all the students At 11th and 12th grades they re giving them a combined work and school experience and then a transition program And again the kids can either go on to college if they want they can go on to technical community they can go on to an entirely a large variety of possibilities and career directions But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often goes on with young people who simply are doing job related or work related work within the classroom within our schools SECRETARY RILEY Thank you very much I think that s going to be the last call that we have time for Mr President I think you ve got to move on to another matter and I want to thank you and Secretary Reich for being here We appreciate your time and your ideas and it s been a tremendous help to us END9 00 P M EDT', 'From Clinton Gore 92 Subject CLINTON Press Briefing by George Stephanopoulos 4 15 93 Organization Project GNU Free Software Foundation 675 Mass

_____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 15 1993 PRESS BRIEFING BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS The Briefing Room 1 04 P M EDT MR STEPHANOPOULOS Good afternoon Q Could we do this on the lawn MR STEPHANOPOULOS That would be nice Let s go out to the cherry blossoms We ll do like the President Q Is the stimulus package dead MR STEPHANOPOULOS Absolutely not Q Can you tell us more about the Dole talks You said it was a good visit but no compromise MR STEPHANOPOULOS Yes The President had a good talk with Senator Dole last night I think that as we said before there were no specific compromises on either side although it was a very good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as well As you know the President first called Senator Dole I believe Tuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package They did not speak Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning when the President was out Instead he spoke with Tony Lake and at the close of that conversation indicated that he wanted to speak to the President about the jobs and stimulus package They finally talked about that yesterday afternoon At the close of that discussion they said that they would have another talk last night which they did when the Senator was up in New Hampshire And although there were no specific compromises made on either side they did say that they would continue to have some discussions And that s where we are Q Well who is giving in Where is it standing are both making concessions MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know that it s at that phase No compromise has been made As the President has said consistently he intends to come forward with an adjusted package He believes in the package but he believes that if it s going to take adjustments to get the minority to release it he s willing to make those adjustments Q On the subject of a VAT MR STEPHANOPOULOS Oh boy Q Can we stay on this for one more minute MR STEPHANOPOULOS Sure Q We have a problem with the five minutes Q I know no decisions have been made but what would lead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary MR STEPHANOPOULOS Sorry Andrea I m not going to go down that road No decisions have been made As the President said this morning a number of groups a number of members of Congress a number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked at The working group is looking at it but no decisions have been made Q To follow have they done that directly through him Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President about it MR STEPHANOPOULOS Not to my knowledge although there s a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the VAT But the President has not made a decision Q At the meetings that he s had with his own task force advisers have they discussed the funding issue and what the possible options would be MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t think that that has been presented for a decision no Q Not for a decision but has it been discussed as an option MR STEPHANOPOULOS Again there are a lot of levels of briefing I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the President as okay this is something for you to decide on Q You re not saying he didn t know it was being considered though are you MR STEPHANOPOULOS No he said it s being considered Q He knew that Q But has he discussed that with his advisers That s what I m asking MR STEPHANOPOULOS The President has said it s being considered I do not know what level of discussion there has been over the VAT It is something the working groups are looking at I don t even know that it s Q But he didn t say he was considering did he at this stage MR STEPHANOPOULOS No he is not I think we re getting into something of a metaphysical debate right here What is considered Q Well he is the one who said I haven t reviewed it MR STEPHANOPOULOS That is true That is what I just repeated Q George is there any concern here that as a result of the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if it were to be considered he d let us know and having it trickle out the way it did that there may now be the development of a credibility gap on this issue and others MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t think so I mean it is now public knowledge that this is being considered Q Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it was off the table and was not being considered and then to have it come out not from you people but MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well wait a second It came out from the administration What are you talking about Q What I m saying is though that the President said he would let us know MR STEPHANOPOULOS Right Q You people then said you said I believe that it s not going to be on the program MR STEPHANOPOULOS On March 25th Q On March 25th MR STEPHANOPOULOS Circumstances change Q Well I understand But we have to find that out by rooting around in the fine print of an interview MR STEPHANOPOULOS Rooting around I know you did do a very good job there to read the USA Today article But this is laughter the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of Health and Human Services I mean that is common anytime you guys write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the Clinton administration the headline is I ll look at it right here and AP story Clinton wants more money for spying Q What about his remark that if it were being considered he d tell us about it MR STEPHANOPOULOS And the administration s concerned and he d let you know Q And did he MR STEPHANOPOULOS Yes Absolutely What did he say this morning Q It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday MR STEPHANOPOULOS It didn t have to be dragged out of me We had the Deputy Director of the OMB we had the Secretary of Health of Human Services say it was being considered That is his administration That is his administration policy Q Were these authorized trial balloons or were they orchestrated leaks I mean what was the MR STEPHANOPOULOS They were asked questions they answered the questions Q You re saying here that it didn t have to be dragged out that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were considering it MR STEPHANOPOULOS Absolutely I was very clear Painfully clear Q Was there a particular political strategy in making it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax day MR STEPHANOPOULOS No it was just this issue is being considered They were asked if it was being considered they answered that it was being considered Q George The New York Times Q Why do it yesterday MR STEPHANOPOULOS They were asked Q The New York Times reports today that Secretary Reich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and oranges numbers in order to portray last month s unemployment figures in a way that was supportive of the President s job stimulus bill but which turned out to be totally false MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know if it was totally false but I think laughter the chief economist at the Labor Department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing and they say that Q The question is is the President concerned about behavior that amounts to corrupting government data And what s he doing about it if so MR STEPHANOPOULOS The chief economist has said that a mistake was made it won t happen again and that s the end of the matter Q Isn t that the same information that goes to the President Q If I could go back to the stimulus package MR STEPHANOPOULOS There s two separate pieces of information I think that s where the confusion was Q When did you all first learn about this mistake that was made MR STEPHANOPOULOS I read the article this morning Q And as far as you know is the President aware of it MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think so Q And was he aware of it before he read about it in The New York Times MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know Not to my knowledge Q Did you ever hear about it before this morning Anything MR STEPHANOPOULOS I didn t Q Wasn t the President given an erroneous spin on this for his own purpose For his speeches for his arguments MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well again I m not sure Both statements are true What the Labor Department has granted is that mixing them in one sentence essentially was misleading They said it was a mistake They said they wouldn t do it again Q Did they drop it is this something that you choose to spin or make an issue of MR STEPHANOPOULOS Whenever fewer people are out of work we re gratified But that doesn t take away from the need to get this jobs package going Q If I could go back to the stimulus package for a minute You said that the President plans to come forward with an amendment Is the timetable still what it was that the amendment would be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday or did he in the conversation with Dole talk about the possibility of putting that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think at this point there s no changes in the schedule at all I don t know that they discussed the timing like that Q Do you believe that you re closer or getting closer this week than you were last week MR STEPHANOPOULOS Again I believe that we re going to pass a jobs package The President is prepared to make adjustments in order to get that to happen I don t know where the votes are on cloture at this particular time I don t know what s going to happen until we have a vote But the President believes deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done Q Has there been any indication that this situation has changed MR STEPHANOPOULOS We re going to continue to work on it We ll know when the votes are taken Q George last week you said that there are or various people in the administration were saying that you couldn t go through Dole you were going to have to try and go around him because he was immovable on this subject of a compromise or at least the compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could accept This week you re talking to him Is that because you ve realized that the peeling off effort wasn t going to work MR STEPHANOPOULOS That s because Senator Dole wanted to talk to the President about the stimulus package Q He initiated the conversation MR STEPHANOPOULOS Yes Q Secretary Reich this morning said that in fact the President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all You say he s making MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know that that s exactly what he said I think he said he didn t have any indication that there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise and the President doesn t want to compromise And the President doesn t want to compromise But if he has to make adjustments to get it through he will Q Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before the actual vote MR STEPHANOPOULOS It s possible Q Today MR STEPHANOPOULOS I m not sure exactly when that will happen but I think that it s very possible that we ll come forward with some sort of a different package or Senate Democrats will come forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it passed Q As we understood his conversations with Dole the first one was some discussion of this and I ll get back to you tonight with some details or some adjustments or whatever the phrase is Did he offer him some details or some adjustments MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think it s a question of how detailed I mean I think they had a general discussion about the package last night subsequent to their conversation yesterday afternoon I believe that there will be follow up discussions today in the Senate not necessarily between the President and Senator Dole And let me just reiterate neither side has made specific compromises at this date When we have something we ll let you know And I m not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that we ve talked about or that we ve offered anything in a hard way Q What are the follow up discussions if not the President and Dole MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think Senator Mitchell is going to talk to Senator Dole Q Is that a threat Laughter Q Did the President say to Senator Dole all right how about this number as an overall size or did Dole say to the President I can go as high as this Did they talk numbers MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t think it was a negotiation in that respect It was more of a discussion about their positions Q Did they discuss actual numbers MR STEPHANOPOULOS I m just not sure I know they talked about the basic outlines of the packages I think they talked about the programs they cared about I don t know if they got to the level of this many x billion dollars Q Does Dole have to sign off before there is a package MR STEPHANOPOULOS No of course not Q Did the White House have anything to do with the protesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole was speaking Was that in any way organized by MR STEPHANOPOULOS Not to my knowledge no Q And has the President been in touch with Senators Kohl or Feingold MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t think he s talked to them no Q George is the President considering the more palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the haves having to continuously pay for the have nots And is he going to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few with the haves having to pay for the have nots MR STEPHANOPOULOS The President believes deeply that the tax rates on upper income Americans as he presented in his budget should go up And I think for the second half of your question I ll refer you to my briefing from yesterday Q George on the subject of accuracy in information you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money that would solve the water problem in Milwaukee Apparently that is not true It s actually waste water money MR STEPHANOPOULOS It s waste water money for Wisconsin and some could go to Milwaukee Q But it would not affect the drinking water problem because it s waste water money right MR STEPHANOPOULOS It would affect the water treatment overall Q But the implication from your statement the other day was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now Would you agree that s not the case MR STEPHANOPOULOS I m not sure of the specifics I know that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin Q A leftover question from this morning which was when did the President find out that the task force was deliberating on a VAT MR STEPHANOPOULOS I m not sure exactly when I just don t know I assume it came up over the last certainly between the time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago Q So sometime since March 25th MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think that s right I don t know the exact date Q George the President this morning mentioned that some labor and business groups are for the VAT tax Apparently the National Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax being okay if it replaces the BTU tax So does the President feel that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he s proposed or is this totally in addition to the other taxes he s already proposed MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think we ve said all we have to say about the VAT at this point I mean there s just no this is being considered by the health care working groups and that is all The President hasn t made any further decisions beyond that Q But it would be to finance health care it wouldn t be to replace some other tax that finances it wouldn t replace the income tax for instance MR STEPHANOPOULOS There have been no discussions on that Q In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress Senator Dole s press release today said VAT on tax day Do you think does it have a chance of getting through Congress Would it have a chance MR STEPHANOPOULOS I have no idea Q Is that a consideration whether you all put it forward MR STEPHANOPOULOS That would become a consideration if the President were to decide to do it It s not in consideration now Q You said at the beginning of the briefing that circumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under consideration MR STEPHANOPOULOS Yes what the President referred to this morning These groups came forward and said this is something that has to be considered Q Those are the circumstances that have changed That s the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled it out that groups have asked it to be considered MR STEPHANOPOULOS That s what he said Q Is that true MR STEPHANOPOULOS Yes Q Was there in fact some understanding that sin taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits MR STEPHANOPOULOS I m not going to get into the deliberations Q But George MR STEPHANOPOULOS No What the consideration is as the President said groups came forward and said this is something you ought to consider The working groups are looking at it Q Is that the only thing that s changed since his prior statement and your prior statement on the VAT MR STEPHANOPOULOS Yes Q Can you explain how those groups how that information got to him that groups wanted it Was it just reading the newspaper or did groups make presentations MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think the groups as you know the health care task force has met with dozens of groups Q But this is the President s knowledge that these groups had come forward MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think he was referring to what was coming to the working groups Obviously there have also been published positions in the newspapers Q Have certain groups briefed him on the group s presentations to them MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know if they ve briefed him I mean how detailed the briefings have been I know that the working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these groups Q What kind of arguments did the groups make that were persuasive enough that the President would change the position that he had enunciated previously MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know it s just they ve had longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance health care Q The President wasn t aware of those longstanding positions MR STEPHANOPOULOS He may have been at some level Obviously he s been a governor for a long time and he knows the basic arguments for and against a VAT tax Q What we re trying to figure out here you re telling us that the only change the only thing that affected this change in the President s attitude toward the VAT between February and now MR STEPHANOPOULOS The President s attitude hasn t necessarily changed I mean he has not made a decision Q I know but the President said that it was off the table So did you And you re saying that the only thing that s changed is the positions of these groups except you re also describing them as longstanding positions I don t see the change If these groups haven t had any change in their position that s been made to the President MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well they ve made the presentations to the health care task force Q There s no relationship at all between the fact that sin taxes that he had said suggested in February that he favored will not produce enough revenue to finance MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t think he ever suggested that they would produce all the revenue Q Well he suggested that he thought that those were appropriate ways to finance health care MR STEPHANOPOULOS He did say that I don t know that he said anything to refute that Q But in fact has the task force discovered that there wouldn t be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind of core benefits MR STEPHANOPOULOS Again I don t think that the task force ever suggested that there would Q George if he advocated a VAT tax would that break his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his programs MR STEPHANOPOULOS I can t comment on a hypothetical situation Q But does that promise would that promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him from seeking a VAT tax MR STEPHANOPOULOS The President has made no decisions on the VAT tax When he does we ll tell you and we ll explain the implications then Q Which specific groups can you cite business labor or otherwise whose recommendations to the health care task force has prompted this consideration MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t have the specific I just don t have that Q George can you tell us to what extend these other alternatives for instance the employer tax or the sin taxes or other financing options are also still on the table and what these options are MR STEPHANOPOULOS No as members of the task force and representatives of the working groups have said they are looking at a wide variety of options I think that Ira Magaziner said that there are 20 different options under consideration But I m not going to comment Q What s the scope MR STEPHANOPOULOS I m just not going to comment on them no Q What s the scope of the need How much are you talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the MR STEPHANOPOULOS That s what the health care task force is looking at Q Since there s not going to be any briefing on the Miyazawa visit two questions One generally what does the President hope to use that meeting for but more specifically is his task complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and the remark about market access at the press conference MR STEPHANOPOULOS The Vancouver note Q Does no mean yes Q Yes and no MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well I don t know I saw the Prime Minister s press conference where he was asked the question about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when he was asked the question The questions of trade are something that certainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the President There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and the U S that we want to do something about Q Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he suggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in terms of trade Are you going to oblige MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think the President will state our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit very clearly I don t necessarily want to agree with your characterization of the Prime Minister s comments Q that we need specific export targets specific numerical targets is that what he s going to discuss with Miyazawa MR STEPHANOPOULOS They re going to have a broad discussion of a wide range of trade issues I don t want to get into those specifics until after the meeting Q Why Q That s the crux of the issue right Whether or not does the President believe that without specific numerical targets it is really as he said in his press conference sort of hopeless that this is going to change very much MR STEPHANOPOULOS The President believes that we must have pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around I do not want to get into the specifics of how that would be done Q But does the President believe that their stimulus package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think first the President wants to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister Miyazawa himself and then he ll make the comment on it Q How about the Russian aid package There seems to be some confusion about how the U S views that Secretary Christopher saying or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do more the Japanese saying that that s not what they heard MR STEPHANOPOULOS Again we re going to continue to work with all our allies in the G 7 and we re going to continue to press for help for Russian reform Russian democratic reform And I think that so far we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and we re going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral packages Q Do you think the Japanese need to do more MR STEPHANOPOULOS We re going to continue to work with all our allies to do as much as we can Q Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today Show this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher s comments on the Bosnia policy And he said It s a rather emotional response MR STEPHANOPOULOS Over an emotional issue Q Right to an emotional problem Does the White House condone that kind of remark MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think that Secretary Christopher s remarks speaks for itself The President believes also that this is a deeply troubling situation that we re trying to find answers for Q But that specific rather emotional response specific term MR STEPHANOPOULOS No it speaks for itself Q In connection with that doesn t it seem that with the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment is it good American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now to help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum MR STEPHANOPOULOS For example Q To take stronger action to take military action air strikes anything that can be done MR STEPHANOPOULOS The President believes that what must be done now is to push harder for sanctions He is also as you know the administration has been discussing lifting the arms embargo He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase pressure at this time Q What is your response to the critics who would say that the U S is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain the presidency MR STEPHANOPOULOS They re wrong We re pressing hard for the Serbs to come to the negotiating table We re pressing hard for increased sanctions and we re talking to our allies about the arms embargo Q You were putting great store in Vance and Owen getting people to agree to that Now Vance and Owen have both said that military force to some extent would be acceptable Does that change your thinking MR STEPHANOPOULOS Clearly we re going to listen to whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to say But at this point the President is moving forward on sanctions and talking about the arms embargo Q A follow up on a Dee Dee comment this morning She said she would be able to provide some administration officials who could document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia Are you going to be able to do that or do you have anything MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t think that s what she said Q That s exactly what she said MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t think that s true But what she said we would look into the situation of what kind of evidence can be provided in Bosnia Obviously if there are connections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and we are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade that will have an effect over time I do not know day by day minute by minute what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact effect has been But clearly we are slowing the shipment of goods into Belgrade We are having an effect on the Serbs there What kind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don t know But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at all I don t know why they d be fighting it so much Q Are the First Lady s tax returns going to be released MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think there s a joint tax return And it will be probably later today Q Is the President considering signing an executive order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work force as part of the gay rights march here next week MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t think there s any proposal for that at this time not that I know of Q It s something that the President promised during the campaign that he would do MR STEPHANOPOULOS I have not seen any I don t think it s anything that s on his plate right now Q Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point on this issue MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know about on this issue I assume that he ll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian community sometime soon as he meets with representatives of lots of different groups and communities Q Do you know if that s scheduled MR STEPHANOPOULOS It s probably going to be tomorrow Q Probably going to be tomorrow Laughter Q It s a good thing you asked Q Who s probably going to be there Laughter MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know Q How long MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know That s all I know Q Do you know if it s at 3 00 p m tomorrow Laughter MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know what time it is I don t even know for sure if it s going to be tomorrow Q Environmental groups have asked him to make a major speech next week of some kind Is that going to happen do you know MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know if they ve asked but I think the President has always planned as he did last year to give a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will If it s not exactly on Earth Day it might be a day before or something like that Q Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of the biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day MR STEPHANOPOULOS Again I don t know the specific timing of something like that but it s certainly something under discussion and something we ve been working on Q Campaign finance reform MR STEPHANOPOULOS We re working on it Q Do you think it will be next week MR STEPHANOPOULOS I m just not sure Q The biodiversity treaty is something you re working on I missed the question MR STEPHANOPOULOS Yes something we re working on He asked if it was ready to be signed and I said I didn t know anything about that but it s something we ve certainly been working on Q Do you know what organizations might be represented in this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t Q Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out of town on the day of the march MR STEPHANOPOULOS He s got to be at the Senate meeting in Jamestown and I believe he s also going to be giving a speech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston on Sunday as he did last year Q Would you have told us if she had not pressed you on the question MR STEPHANOPOULOS On what Q On the gays MR STEPHANOPOULOS When we went through the President s schedule for the day certainly Q George what day is the publisher s speech Is that Sunday MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think it s a Sunday Q And Saturday he ll be in Jamestown MR STEPHANOPOULOS Yes Q So you re just going to be in Jamestown for one day MR STEPHANOPOULOS No I m not sure I don t know how long the Senate thing goes It might go overnight I just don t know Q You would have made the gay meeting public right MR STEPHANOPOULOS I m certain if we had the meeting I don t know about open to the press but we would have told you about it Q I mean because it is as far as I can tell the first time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with MR STEPHANOPOULOS I didn t say it was going to be in the Oval Office Laughter But I didn t I m not say that it s not but I didn t say that it was Laughter Q at the White House in the Bush administration gay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White House had to repudiate having done that So I just wanted to make sure MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well the President wouldn t do anything like that Q Certainly not Q What marching orders did the President give to General Vessey MR STEPHANOPOULOS They had a very good discussion for about half an hour today He wanted the most important thing was he had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs He will obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document The President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes in our policy towards Vietnam He ll be looking at Vietnam s response to the questions raised by the document and he ll also look into investigations on discrepancy cases increased efforts on remains implementing trilateral investigations and access to military archives And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the activities of the joint commission and on the document Q Vietnam says it s a fake What is the DOD analysis at this stage MR STEPHANOPOULOS It s not completed yet and it s also the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the Vietnamese Q A number of Defense officials have been saying that they think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are in fact non Americans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to as Americans from time to time Do people MR STEPHANOPOULOS We don t have any final determination We re going to wait for the complete review when we have it we ll make a judgment Q I know you don t have any final determination but given all of the intense public interest in this do you think that that s a likely possibility MR STEPHANOPOULOS I just don t want to characterize it in any way until the review is complete Q George was there a topic scheduled for the speech in Boston MR STEPHANOPOULOS No Q Is the President going to have a press conference tomorrow with Miyazawa MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think so but I m not positive Yes I expect yes Q Was Toon in with Vessey MR STEPHANOPOULOS Yes Q He was in on the meeting MR STEPHANOPOULOS Yes Q What was the question MR STEPHANOPOULOS Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey and the answer is yes Q Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal report this morning the President s distressed about some of his press clippings and that perhaps he s distressed with you about that MR STEPHANOPOULOS No Well I do have a response I think the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied that the President has had restricted access to the press I would point out that he s answered 358 questions on 77 occasions more than any of his predecessors I would also point out it also Q How many questions MR STEPHANOPOULOS Three hundred fifty eight on 77 occasions Q How many were while he was jogging MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well no that s actually a very good question Andrea And I would point out further that the article also implied that these questions were only answered at tightly controlled photo opportunities which is just patently false He s had 13 press conferences in either the East Room the Oval Office or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room in addition to questions taken at photo opportunities and that is only the Q Oval Office press conference when was that MR STEPHANOPOULOS He s answered questions in the East Room He s had five in the East Room he s had one in the Oval Office he s had one in the Rose Garden he s had one or two in the Roosevelt Room And this is just to the White House Washington Press Corps In addition to that he s had 17 interviews with local television anchors He s met with the editorial board of The Portland Oregonian He s had an hour long interview with Dan Rather He s had interviews with local press from California Florida and Connecticut Q Can you address the question of the attitude The article implies that he doesn t Q Why doesn t he like us Laughter Q Did you really get blamed for that Post story Q The story is that you are you held responsible for it MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t think I m going to comment about this Q Are you denying that the President has shown displeasure publicly MR STEPHANOPOULOS I am not commenting on the discussions between the President and myself Q Did the President write that letter to Chris Webber MR STEPHANOPOULOS What Q The letter to the University of Michigan basketball player MR STEPHANOPOULOS Oh yes Q That is an authentic letter MR STEPHANOPOULOS Yes Q Since the President first talked about the VAT in February he said at the time that he thought there probably should be exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing Does he still hold that position given the impact it could have MR STEPHANOPOULOS Again I just can t comment on a proposal he hasn t made Q George does the President have some agenda for this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well I think it will just a general meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about including AIDS and other issues civil rights Q The military issue MR STEPHANOPOULOS I m certain it will come up Q Is he using this event to name the AIDS MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t think so Q George what specifically is the President doing to prepare for tomorrow s meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa MR STEPHANOPOULOS He s had briefing memos He s had general discussions with members of the Treasury Department the Trade Representative and others Q report yet MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know if he has the report referred to in The Times but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him today Q He was MR STEPHANOPOULOS Yes Q Does he intend to use any of these instances that MR STEPHANOPOULOS Again I don t know that the report s been presented But obviously the President will press hard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred Q In terms of the Wall Street Journal the thrust was that there s a real schism here a hostility Do you think he feels that way MR STEPHANOPOULOS Not at all As I said on the record in the article I think the President likes reporters Again I think that the thrust of the article was still misleading The thrust of the article was that in some way some attitude which the President may or may not have is affecting access when in fact he has the most open accessible administration than have any in recent history Q Can we come up to your office Laughter MR STEPHANOPOULOS If you re invited THE PRESS Thank you END 1 34 P M EDT 57 04 15', 'From Clinton Gore 92 Subject CLINTON Press Briefing by George Stephanopoulos

_____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 5 1993 PRESS BRIEFING BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS The Briefing Room 10 10 A M EDT MR STEPHANOPOULOS As you know the President is soon to be on his way on Amtrack to Camden Yards He ll be throwing out the first pitch Q It s MARC the Maryland Area Transit it s not Amtrack MR STEPHANOPOULOS Oh it s not Amtrack Well he s going from Union Station you re right Excuse me Q George what exactly are you prepared to do to break the logjam with Senate MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well as you know there are discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point that he believes that our investment package our jobs package needs to be passed as quickly as possible We need this investment for summer jobs for immunization for highway construction for the important programs that will put people back to work right away this summer And the President continues to believe his program should be passed Q Will he compromise that s the question MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well as you know the discussions are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole let s see what they come up with But the President believes his jobs program should go forward Q George would the President be willing to accept 8 billion for one year which apparently appears to be the compromise being offered by MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well I don t know what is being offered by either side The Senate discussions are going on right now let s see what happens today Q Would he go that far no matter what the Republicans have offered so far would he go that far 8 billion per year MR STEPHANOPOULOS The President believes that his program should be passed at this time Clearly we re going to be willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to come up with but I m not going to get into figures right now Let s see what happens Q It s reasonable to assume isn t it from what has happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order to get a vote MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well the Republicans seem more intrested in stopping progress on the President s jobs bill than in doing something to create MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well the Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the President s jobs bill than in doing something to create real action real jobs this summer for the American people I think there s no question about that There s been some frustration of legislative activity over the last few days Q So you ll need to compromise to get your package through MR STEPHANOPOULOS We ll see what happens with the conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning Q prepared to compromise MR STEPHANOPOULOS The President s prepared to listen to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting with Senator Dole Q Does he feel that he has been defeated in his MR STEPHANOPOULOS Not in the least In fact he s been very successful so far in the beginning of his term Q How MR STEPHANOPOULOS He passed his budget in record time in six weeks and it s a budget which reduces the deficit by 500 billion over five years And it s a budget which provides for important investments in our future Right now we ve also had strong passage of his jobs program through the House Simply because a minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock and hold up action on the President s jobs program is not a sign that he is not succeeding overall Q He can t beat this can he Q The fact is they can do that MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well the Republicans can stop action There s no question about that Q What are you going to do about it Q George what do you know about these alleged notes taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese that when they say yes they mean no MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think that s a complete misreading of what happened at the meeting The context of the conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister s belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G 7 process I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese were serious about their commitment to the G 7 process Q Are you saying that the President said that when the Japanese say yes they mean no MR STEPHANOPOULOS That s not I don t know the exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G 7 process Q Have there been any attempts to explain this to the Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and there appears to be MR STEPHANOPOULOS I ve seen the reports in the Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context It does talk about the Japanese understanding the Japanese points of view I don t think it s going to be a problem I believe that there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up but I m not positive Q George was the specific comment that was made specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general observation on Japanese etiquette MR STEPHANOPOULOS The discussion was about Q The specific comment is what I m asking about that has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes when the Japanese say yes they mean no MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well it was a combination I mean I don t think that s the whole sentence I think that the specific comment was a broad general observation followed up by a specific finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment Q Was he saying it facetiously first MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think it was just a casual observation Q And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to clear it up Has the President sent a message MR STEPHANOPOULOS No I don t think the President spoke I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but I m not sure exactly how many Q Well this obviously is a bigger deal than you re making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls MR STEPHANOPOULOS No no It was just that we got the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no MR STEPHANOPOULOS reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood and make sure there is absolutely no misunderstanding and I don t believe there is on Q What is our position about the Japanese That they may have to say one thing but actualy mean another MR STEPHANOPOULOS No The position on the Japanese is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two days He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit He reiterated the U S position the long standing support for the Japanese position on the Kuril Islands but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa s commitment to move forward on the G 7 process and to play a constructive role And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to hear that Q After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq for the last few days I m a little confused What is the U S policy Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned MR STEPHANOPOULOS It s the same policy that Secretary Christopher has reiterated and all of the U S officials have reiterated We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance with all U N resolutions Right now we do not have that compliance Q throwing it out further that if Iraq complies Saddam can t stay in office MR STEPHANOPOULOS Right I think that that s our judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with the resolutions and stay in power But the important point is that we expect compliance by Iraq with all U N resolutions and we will continue to demand it Q And are you concerned the Iran will become the dominant power in the area MR STEPHANOPOULOS Secretary Christopher has also spoken to Iran over the last several days and he says we also expect full Iranian compliance with all international norms and stopping support of terrorism Q That s a very glib statement that he won t stay in power if he complies with U N resolutions On what logic do you base that MR STEPHANOPOULOS Right now Saddam Hussein is not complying with the U N resolutions at all He is not respecting the rights of his people as is required by the U N resolution He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding armaments Q Well when do you think that if he did comply he would be out of power MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well right now his power rests on the repression of his people If he stopped doing that it would make it more difficult for him to stay in power Q George back on the stimulus package why is it that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure politics and perpetuating gridlock Why is it that what evidence do you have that they just don t have a genuine idealogical difference with you that s in good faith MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well the fact that several times in the past the Republicans many of the ones who are now leading the fight for the filibuster have supported the very funding they now seek to stop most especially the highway funding Q George in regards to that some of the moderate Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to them during the while the plan was put together that they had one sort of proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate Republicans and that was it Does the Administration look back and thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well I m not sure that it s true that there was only one meeting I mean the President met with the Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the introduction of his package He met with the entire Senate Republican Caucus also for lunch and went up there We are continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who have an interest in the President s package We are interested in what they have to say as well But we believe that this program is important and we re going to continue to fight for it Q your all or nothing do it with the Democrats alone strategy did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it through MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well I mean I think that there is no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can frustrate activity I mean there is just no question about that You only need 40 plus one to keep going 40 plus one to keep going and to stop any action and that s what the Republicans are doing Q going to rethink the way you attempt to get other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of the summer Q work with Republicans and try to woo some Republicans into your camp MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think we re going to continue to look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the President s intiatives Q But on this one how are you going to do it differently than you did it on this one because on this one you really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and could get it through and you really didn t need Republican votes Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for particular votes When you have to go through MR STEPHANOPOULOS I can t see into the future and understand every possible turn in the legislative road Clearly the President s going to continue to reach out when he can Q You don t have any regrets then about the way you have handled it up to now and you don t plan any changes in your approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this experience MR STEPHANOPOULOS Obviously the President would like his package passed as quickly as possible and he s going to continue to press for that We will continue to reach out to Republicans there s not question about that And we ll continue to reason with them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation In this case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster around a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward Q They re being denied any other legislative means of putting their proposals forward MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think they re being Q any ideas MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think their amendments are being defeated I don t know that they re being denied Q to present them MR STEPHANOPOULOS That s not exactly true I mean they get the votes Q that theirs can be passed though by the parliamentary rules under which they re playing MR STEPHANOPOULOS Unless they get a majority in support all the way around no that s not exactly true Q George one more on Iraq Is the administration backing any of the Iraqi opposition Grooming any new leadership Q backing any of the Iraqi leadership MR STEPHANOPOULOS Oh I again we re pressing for Iraqi compliance I don t know if we can get into the business of grooming leadership I believe there have been some contacts at some levels with Iraqi opposition groups I don t know about anything recently Q Jesse Jackson who of course is not the President s best friend has however been told that there is to be some kind of town meeting or some kind of involvement by the President pre empted the ball game Los Angeles Will he consider something like that or any other kind of intervention there MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well as you know the President appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown about 10 days ago to be a special envoy to California and coordiante cabinet activities around the California economic situation including the situation in Los Angeles I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles by the Education or have been visits by the Education Secretary Mr Riley I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD Secretary Cisneros are also going out And there may be other visits by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks I wouldn t rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to California Obviously he is following the situation closely and is concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities which help prevent disturbances But we re going to continue to watch it Q George as a follow up Reverend Jackson is also supposed to be outside the ball park today in Baltimore with a group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball management Does the President have a position on that MR STEPHANOPOULOS The President has received correspondence from Reverend Jackson I know that Reverend Jackson has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty He clearly raises serious questions There has been some progress in baseball over the last several years but still not enough But the President intends to continue to go to the ball game Q Is he going to say anything about it today or see Reverend Jackson while he s out there MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know if he is going to see them but as I said the President believes that Reverend Jackson has raised some serious questions and it s something that as I said even though there has been progress it s clearly not enough Q Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball game MR STEPHANOPOULOS I m not sure about that I believe the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an informational pickett I don t know that he asked him not to go to the ball game but he sent a long detailed formal letter outlining his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the President read it Q George the Orioles are playing the Rangers the managing partner of the Rangers is George W Bush Is he going to be there and is he going to meet with the President MR STEPHANOPOULOS I don t know Q What is the Mubarak schedule MR STEPHANOPOULOS I know that President Mubarak is coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting they will have a lunch and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice President Gore Q And joint statements tomorrow MR STEPHANOPOULOS I believe so yes At the end yes Q Is there evidence George that the Egyptians did warn the U S about a potential terrorist bombing terrorist activities MR STEPHANOPOULOS As reported in The New York Times I mean I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been general conversations with the Egyptians as there have been for a long period of time We do have general intelligence sharing I mean But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward The President will continue to investigate the situation but he also reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind Q George he did make specific or the Egyptians apparently did issue specific warnings about this individual who forgive me this individual who forgive me the name escapes me at the moment and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in their attempts to get some kind of action MR STEPHANOPOULOS Again I don t know if I would agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview He did say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate action But there was no specific information on this specific operation at all Q So the White House doesn t feel that any of the law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in not pursuing some kind of MR STEPHANOPOULOS No not at all Q What s next with Serbia It got only a passing mention in the news conference yesterday MR STEPHANOPOULOS You didn t get to ask your question Q Yes exactly Was there any agreement on concerted action between the two countries And even if there wasn t what does the U S do next MR STEPHANOPOULOS I think the U S is clearly going to move forward in the U N today continuing discussions with our allies on a sanctions resolution and we ll continue to look for ways to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an agreement Q George why do you think sanctions is still an option I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day said there s no evidence that they re going to have an effect any time soon The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan When does no mean no and you have to do something different MR STEPHANOPOULOS Well I mean we are doing something different We re moving forward on further sanctions through the U N and those discussions will continue We re going to continue to try and tighten the noose on Serbia and I think that every opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time Q Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo MR STEPHANOPOULOS The President has said that this is something that is under consideration Q George do you have any more on Hugh Rodham s condition how he s doing MR STEPHANOPOULOS As far as I know nothing s changed Q George week after Mr Mubarak MR STEPHANOPOULOS It s a little unclear I think we ll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning after the Mubarak visit Q Is he going somewhere for Easter MR STEPHANOPOULOS Not that I know of Q What more can you tell us about the additional aid to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about MR STEPHANOPOULOS He s going to be consulting with the Congress and with our G 7 partners over the next couple of weeks I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their delegation before the the congressional delegation meets with the Russians this week and those consultations will

really a mechanical drum type odometer that is driven by pulses from a speed sensor on the rear axle These pulses are converted into mechanical pulses that turn the odometer and speedometer No way changing or erasing an eprom is going to change the mileage reading It also means the odometer is just as easy or hard to change as any other mechanical odometer On the other hand it is a bit easier

used all of the original equipment so I suppose the sensor could have used replacement Performance hah if you could call it that did not change Perhaps emissions increased but how much emissions could a CA registered 3 cylinder engine produce That was a neat car I held the engine block easily in one hand Has anyone ever driven the Turbo variant Just curious Adam Edwards', 'From ZINGALE THOMAS J

Srinagesh Gavirneni writes I have a 86 chevy sprint with a c and 4doors It s odometer turned 90k and the sensor light started blinking I went to the dealer and he said it was a maintenance light saying I need to change the Oxygen sensor He said It is to be changed every 30k but since I bought the car when it had 77k I don t know if the same thing happened at 30k and 60k He quoted 198 for the part and 50 to install it The part cost 30 outside but the mechanic I went to could not fix it saying the sensor is placed too deep in the engine parts He suggested I wait till it malfunctions before I do anything If anyone out there owns a chevy sprint I want to know how they got their Oxygen sensors changed Also did you face any problem with fixing it without the dealer s help Also what are the results of the oxygen sensor malfunction Any help would be greatly apprecisted Thanks Nagesh I have owned my Sprint from the beginning and that sensor light comes on every 30K to let you know it s time for a check up When that light goes on I just take it to the delaer tell them It s that time and they work on it for 4 hou and you pay 5 for parts and 100 for labor Ahh what they get for labor I currently have about 95K on my Sprint and of all the times I took it in for service I never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the Oxygen sensor What the heck is an Oxygen sensor As far an I know of I have never had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten Now I don t have a c Mother Nature does that for me and that might have something to do with it but I still never heard of an Oxygen sensor The only MAJOR service job I have had on my car besides getting the tires replaced if you want to call that a service job was getting the Rotor Distributor and Gasket replaced And that was all done within the past 2 months What I do at 30K is have a good tune up let them replace what ever they need to pay the bill about 125 and go home and don t worry about the car for another 30K Oh I just remembered something If that little sensor light bothers you in the fuse box right below the turn signal lever up against the dash there is a swith on the right side Flip that switch and the light will go off I do that so that little light won t annoy me If you can t find it look it up in the car manuel I hope that I have helped a little and good

thermodynamically in many fossil fuel plants and of course there is less danger of radioactive contamination Actually fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual boiling water reactor nuclear plants There s a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology So it s more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible Hence big cooling towers Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water not most of the way down to ambient Some plants do cool the condensers with water rather than air as one Canadian official asked about thermal pollution de icing a river said Up here we view heat as a resource Everybody runs closed cycle boilers The water used is purified of solids which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when the water boils Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than cooling it so the boiler water is recycled John Nagle']"

is supposedly the fast and best now It has an access of 200ms and a data transfer rate 300Kb sec It is multisession photo cd compatible It is available from educorp for 599 the CD Technology one and comes with two mail in coupons for two free CDs I m not sure if the cd s are good since I ve only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd s shipped to my home address in california instead of here in maryland The CD technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive which supposedly gives it a longer life and keeps it cleaner with no fan to attract dust A Toshiba brand drive is also available but I think the CD Technology is better since you get the same mechanism and at a slightly lower price with two free CDs The Apple 300 330i Drive Sony Mechanism is around a 300ms access time I think and a data transfer rate of 300Kb sec I know it is the slowest of the three mentioned here It is not widely available except through the apple catalog which is bad at a price of only 599 It is also multi session photo cd compatible I think the external model comes with 7 free cds some of which are pretty good The NEC drive has been out the longest it has an access time of 280ms and a data transfer rate of 300Kb sec it is available from many vendors around 600 dollars including Educorp It wasn t multi sesssion photo cd compatible before but I hear that the current version that is shipping is Owners of the older drives can get an upgrade It does not come with any free cd s unless you buy it in a bundle Of the three CD Rom drives above i think the best choices would be the Apple drive and the CD technology toshiba drive The apple drive for it s compatibility with apple products and the cd technology toshiba for it s speed and performance BTW the models of the drives are Apple AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i internal CD Technology CD T3401 the Toshiba brand name model I m not sure but it is also something like with 3401 NEC CDR 74 I m very happy with my drive And have had no compatibility problems whatsoever If I am wrong about any of the above do correct me but I am pretty sure of myself even when I think I m not Also some of you out there might notice that I have the same last name as the president of CD Technology which happens to be in southern california my hometown However I AM NOT a relative nor do I know the guy Liu is just a common chinese name especially in southern california with the enormous chinese community Besides one of my doctors in california has three Steve Liu s as patients and another Steve Liu comes to my

5of5 Organization Florida State University Lines 36 In response to some of the discussions on the Sabbath Andrew Byler commented that if we really followed sola scriptura we would worship on Saturday the change to Sunday was a law made by the Church and we don t acknowledge its authority to make laws I noted that Protestants do not consider Sunday worship a law clh He was not referring to the FAQ but to the five Sabbath Admissions posted on the bible study group This is what prompted someone to send the FAQ to me The argument against the Sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law and like the rest of the n ceremonial law is not binding on Christians You cannot show from scripture that the weekly Sabbath is part of the ceremonial laws Before you post a text in reply investigate its context If you accept that the Sabbath is not binding on Christians then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual Christians or since worship is by its nature a group activity churches are free to decide Can the churches also decide what is and is not sin Interesting Where there is no divine imperative of course we must establish rules of operation But we cannot be as creative with what God has explicitly spoken on Darius Again in the normal Protestant interpretation Sunday is not a law and worshipping on another day is not a sin Churches are free to decide on the day they will meet just as they are free to decide on the hour It would not be a sin to worship on some other day but if you belong to a church that worships on Sunday and you show up on Monday you will probably worship alone clh', 'From Darius_Lecointe Subject Re Sabbath Admissions 5of5 Organization Florida State University Lines 227 Someone sent me this FAQ by E mail and I post my response here I m not enforcing the inclusion limits on this FAQ because most of our readers probably haven t seen it clh Christ warns that anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches otheres to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven Matt 5 19 This FAQ is so full of error that I must respond to it I hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the partisan theology Brothers and Sisters Being new to the faith and examining the Decalogue closely I ve noticed the fourth commandment is pretty specific about keeping the Sabbath day It states the 7th day Saturday is the Sabbath while most Christian religions keep or atleast go to church on Sunday What s up This is a frequently asked question Every time it arises it causes months of debate So let me see if I can answer you directly Basically it s because the Law was given to Moses as part of a specific covenanent with the Jews Most of us aren t Jews so we aren t part of that covenant There was an argument early in Christian history about whether the Mosaic laws should apply to Gentiles who became Christians You can see the account of this debate in Acts 15 The main question there was circumcision but keeping the Sabbath would be part of it as well The apostles concluded that we need not become Jews in order to become Christians and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us 1 The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai Rom 4 15 notes that where no law is there is no transgression Not only did sin exist before Sinai Eden but the Sabbath was kept before it was revealed on Sinai Ex 16 2 The problem with the first covenant was not the law but the promise which undergirded it God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the people but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery they promised what ever He says to do we will do That is why the new covenant is based on better promises Heb 8 6 Rather than do away with the law God promised to put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts Heb 8 10 3 Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion The Sabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision If any attempt had been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is recorded in Acts 15 Do not confuse the weekly Sabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at any time of the week and were part of the law ceremonial which was added because of transgression of the moral law Gal 3 19 4 Israel stands for God s people of all time That is why God grafted the Gentiles in Roma 9 4 says that the adoption the glory the covenants the giving of the law the service of God and the promises belong to Israelites In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born into Israel is not enough For they are not all Israel which are of Israel v 6 Then in Gal 3 19 he says if ye be Christ s then are ye Abraham s seed and heirs according to the promise All Christians are Abraham s seed Jews Israelites Not physically for that is not the criterion but spiritually We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the promise God made to all his people the Israelites While Christians agree that the OT Laws do not all apply to us because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the Jews we also expect to see some similarity between the things God expected from the Jews and the things he expects from us After all it s the same God However there are several ways of dealing with this These days the most common approach is to separate the OT commandments into moral and ceremonial Ceremonial commandments apply only to the Jews They are part of the specific Mosaic covenant These are thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision Moral laws apply to everyone Most of the 10 commands are part of the moral law except for the commandment about the Sabbath I believe most people who take this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on the Sabbath is part of the ceremonial law but a general obligation to worship regularly is part of the general moral law Thus Christians are free to choose the specific time we worship People would probably agree but they are wrong How can the Sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the ceremonial laws You are not free to choose your time of worship Even if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan sun worship Would you rather give up a day which God blessed sanctified and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation see Sabbath Admissions in soc religion christian bible study A more radical approach which is generally connected with John Calvin and the Reformed tradition says that the Law as a whole is no longer binding Instead we are entirely under grace and our behavior should be guided solely by love Portions of the OT Law are still useful as guidance But they are not properly speaking legally binding on us In practice most people who take this position do not believe it is safe to leave Christians without moral guidannce While we may no longer be under Law as sinners it s not safe for us to go into situations with no principles to guide us We re too good at self justification for that to be safe Thus Christians do have moral guidance from things like Jesus teachings Paul s advice etc These may not be precisely a Law but they serve much the same function as and have largely the same content as the moral law in the previous analysis While Calvin would deny that we have a fixed legal responsibility to worship on any specific day he would say that given human weakness the discipline of regular worship is important I do not care what Calvin or any theologian says My guide is what God says If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the Sabbath commandment which is the only one God thought was important enough to say REMEMBER If you study the word deeply you will note that the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of God If a cop pulls me over for speeding then in court I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me grace do I walk out of the court saying I can now go on speeding for I am now under grace Being under grace I now drive within the speed limit Paul adds to it in Rom 3 31 Di we then make void the law through faith God forbid yea we establish the law Wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good Rom 7 12 In both analyses the specific day is not an issue As a matter of tradition we worship on Sunday as a memorial of Christ s resurrection There s some debate about what Acts shows about early Christian worship The most common analysis is that is shows Jewish Christians continuing to go to Jewish services on the Sabbath but that specifically Christian service were not necessarily held then Act 20 7 shows worship on the first day Sunday and I Cor 16 2 also implies gatherings on that day There are a few groups that continue to believe Christians have to worship on the Sabbath Saturday The best known are the Seventh Day Adventists and Jehovah s Witnesses They argue that Act 20 7 is not a regular worship service but a special meeting to see Paul off and that I Cor 16 2 doesn t explicitly say it s a regular worship service Do you prefer implication to fact A careful study of the Acts 20 shows that the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did not go to a worship service but set off on a long journey by foot to Assos In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate lay by him in store with go to a worship service It s clear that this issue was a contested one in Paul s time See Rom 14 5 Paul s advice is that we should be very careful about judging each other on issues like this One person sees a specific day as mandated by God while another does not He who observes that specific day does it in honor of the Lord He who believes his worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the Lord Those who believe that the Sabbath is still mandated argue that Paul is not referring to Sabbath worship here Note however Col 2 16 which says something similar but briefer It explicitly mentions Sabbath Wrong These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law not the Sabbath day of the moral law There are some differences among Christians about use of the word Sabbath Originally the term referred to the 7th Day the Jewish day of worship Many Christians now use it to refer to Sunday the day of Christian worship They do this largely so that they can apply the 4th or whatever there are a couple of different numbering schemes commandment to it Reformed tradition does not do this It distinguishes between the Sabbath which is the observance mandated for Jews and the Lord s Day which is the free Christian worship The only reference I can find to this in the NT is Rev 1 10 There are also differences about laws regarding this day Many Christians support blue laws both in secular law and church law setting aside that day and causing people to spend it in worship The more radical anti legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the Jewish Sabbath which is not appropriate to the free Christian worship of the Lord s Day Why would you prefer to twist and turn relying on different arguments which conflict with each other rather than obey a simple request from a God who loved you enough to die for you Jesus died because the law could not be changed Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a broken law if all you need to do is change the law Penalties for law breaking means the law is immutable That is why it is no sin not to follow the demands of the ceremonial laws It will always be a sin to make false gods to violate God s name to break the Sabbath to steal to kill etc Except it you disagree But then your opinion has no weight when placed next to the word of God Darius It s not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ I think Paul s comments on esteeming one day over another Rom 14 is probably all that needs to be said I accept that Darius is doing what he does in honor of the Lord I just wish he might equally accept that those who esteem all days alike are similarly doing their best to honor the Lord However I d like to be clear that I do not think there s unambiguous proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day As I indicated there are responses on both of the passages cited The difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else They both look like they are talking about nnregular Christian meetings but neither explicitly says and they gathered every Sunday for worship We get various pieces of information but nothing aimed at answering this question Act 2 26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple worship and in Christian communion services in homes Obviously the temple worship is on the Sabbath Acts 13 44 is an example of Christians participating in them Unfortunately it doesn t tell us what day Christians met in their houses Acts 20 7 despite Darius confusion is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday I see no reason to impose modern definitions of when days start when the Biblical text is clear about what was meant The wording implies to me that this was a normal meeting It doesn t say they gathered to see Paul off but that when they were gathered for breaking bread Paul talked about his upcoming travel But that s just not explicit enough to be really convincing Similarly with 1 Cor 16 2 It says that on the first day they should set aside money for Paul s collection Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this or that they did it in their homes I can t disprove it but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day So I think the most obvious reading of this is that on the first day of every week simply means every time they gather for worship I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian worship was clh', 'From Paul Harvey Subject Re Sabbath Admissions 5of5 Organization The

faith Do you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith Do you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith you read Jesus word in Matt5 14 19 Is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is sin Greek hamartia missing the mark Is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is missing the mark However I d like to be clear that I do not think there s unambiguous proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day As I indicated there are responses on both of the passages cited Whereas the Ten Commandments and Jesus words in Matt5 14 19 are fairly clear are they not Are they clear or do you have doubts No I don t believe that Paul can overrule God An important first step the realization that Paul was human However Paul was writing for a largely Gentile audience Yes and he was writing and speaking for an audience that was at best very weak in the faith most could not read most were unfamiliar with the Hebrew Scriptures in even the Septuagint form Paul adapted the message of the Bible to a largely uneducated market Granted this market still exists today but do you count yourself as part of it To be weak in the faith is not missing the mark hamartia if you do the best that your education allows Are you doing the best The Law was regarded by Jews at the time and now as binding on Jews but not on Gentiles There are rules that were binding on all human beings the so called Noachic laws but they are quite minimal Let me make clear that the Law is none other than the Pentateuch of Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy What did Jesus say about the Law in Matt5 14 19 Where did Jesus say that the Law only applies to Jews and that Gentiles are above the Law The issue that the Church had to face after Jesus death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ The decision not to impose the Law on them didn t say that the Law was abolished It simply acknowledged that fact that it didn t apply to Gentiles Who acknowledged this fact On what basis Are we extra biblical at this point Why not also acknowledge that the Bhagavad Gita is the only relevant text for Gentiles after all we see in the Bible that it was Magus from the east who observed the star signs of Jesus Why bother with any texts at all Why not just follow whatever the Church has to say Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5 I don t see how you can say this with a straight face Are you a follower of Christ or do you follow someone else Are you saying that the words of Jesus only apply to Jews As far as I can tell both Paul and other Jewish Christians did continue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath Thus they continued to obey the Law How Jewish was Paul after he changed his name from Saul The issue was and is with Gentile Christians who are not covered by the Law or at least not by the ceremonial aspects of it Who says Gentile Christians are not covered by the first five books Who says that Gentile Christians are above the Ten Commandments Jesus dealt mostly with Jews I think we can reasonably assume that Mat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience You re implying that Jesus words are valid only for Jews Is this really what you mean to say You do realize that you are gutting rather large portions of the Bible When you read Jesus words did you ever consider that maybe just maybe Jesus is talking to you no matter what your race or sex If the Hebrew Scriptures and the Gospel accounts of Jesus are only directed to Jews why were they translated into English He did interact with Gentiles a few times e g the centurion whose slave was healed and a couple of others The terms used to describe the centurion see Luke 7 suggest that he was a God fearer i e a Gentile who followed God but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law As Paul would call him one who was weak in the faith He was commended by Jewish elders as a worthy person and Jesus accepted him as such This seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view that Gentiles need not accept the Law Which is more important 1 The recorded word of Jesus or 2 Indications that you can deduce from the Bible Was Jesus God only of the Jews or God of all humankind of all race and sex However there s more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on the Law In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law we have to come to grips with Paul s apparent rejection of the Law and how that relates to Jesus commendation of the Law At least as I read Paul he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded This is your understanding of Paul Compare this to the word of Jesus Are you Christian or Pauline Again this issue isn t one of the abolition of the Law In the middle of his discussion Paul notes that he might be understood this way and assures us that that s not what he intends to say Rather he sees the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness But ultimately it s an impossible standard and one that has been superceded by Christ Again this is your understanding of Paul Did Jesus say that the Law was an impossible standard Did Jesus say that He superceded the Law Are you Christian or Pauline Paul s comments are not the world s clearest here and not everyone agrees with my reading You acknowledge that it is your reading of Paul What did Jesus say Can you deny that Matt5 14 19 is quite clear in its meaning Are you Christian or Pauline But the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law It still remains as an uncompromising standard from which not an iota or dot may be removed For its purpose of convicting of sin it s important that it not be relaxed When did Jesus say that the purpose of the Law was conviction of sin However for Christians it s not the end ultimately we live in faith not Law Please reread Matt5 14 19 Are you Christian or Pauline Jesus interpretations emphasize the intent of the Law and stay away from the ceremonial details Are you saying that the Ten Commandments are ceremonial details Paul s conclusion is similar While he talks about the Law being superceded all of the specific examples he gives involve the ceremonial law such as circumcision and the Sabbath He is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards You call observance of the Sabbath the day on which the Lord rested ceremonial Has circumcision been superceded for Christians Are you Christian or Pauline Both There is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is not at least not in this case Jesus did not deal explicitly with the question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles That s why I have to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion As to general Jewish views on this I am dependent largely on studies of Pauline theology one by H J Schoeps and one whose author I can t come up with at the moment Both authors are Jews Also various Christian and non Christian Jews have discussed the issue here and in other newsgroups Mat 5 19 is clear that the Law is still valid It does not say that it applies to Gentiles And yes I say that the specific requirement for worship on the Sabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail when you re looking at the obligations of Gentiles Similarly circumcision I m not sure quite what else I can say on this subject Again it s unfortunate the Jesus didn t answer the question directly However we do know 1 what the 1st Cent Jewish approach was 2 how Jesus dealt with at least one Gentile and 3 how Jesus disciples dealt with the issue when it became more acute I m referring to Acts 15 more than Paul Given that these are all in agreement I don t see that there s a big problem clh']"

is your evidence for that god is is meaningful at some level Once again you seem to completely misunderstand me I have no EVIDENCE that god is is meaningful at ANY level Maybe such a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so many people try to run their own private conception of God down your throat I however am not doing this I am arguing one and only one thing that to make a positive assertion about something for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against requires a leap it requires faith I am as you would say a theist however there is a form of atheism that I can respect but it must be founded upon honesty Benedikt bob singleton', 'From Robert Singleton Subject Re Americans and Evolution Organization Massachvsetts Institvte of Technology Lines 122 Distribution world NNTP Posting Host thnext mit edu In article Simon Clippingdale writes deleted over on alt atheism we tend to recognise two categories of atheism Function format due to I think i weak not believe gods ii strong believe not gods deleted I am a strong atheist and I must quibble with your assertion that the strong position requires faith I believe that no god s as commonly described by theists exist This belief is merely an opinion formed on the basis of observation including a certain amount of introspection I fully accept that I could be wrong and will be swayed by suitably convincing evidence Thus while I believe that no gods exist this does not imply faith on my part that it is so Let me first say that to believe that no gods exist is in fact different than not believing in a god or gods I will argue that your latter statement I believe that no gods exist does rest upon faith that is if you are making a POSITIVE statement that no gods exist strong atheism rather than merely saying I don t know and therefore don t believe in them and don t NOT believe in then weak atheism Once again to not believe in God is different than saying I BELIEVE that God does not exist I still maintain the position even after reading the FAQs that strong atheism requires faith But first let me say the following We might have a language problem here in regards to faith and existence I as a Christian maintain that God does not exist To exist means to have being in space and time God does not HAVE being God IS Being Kierkegaard once said that God does not exist He is eternal With this said I feel it s rather pointless to debate the so called existence of God and that is not what I m doing here I believe that God is the source and ground of being When you say that god does not exist I also accept this statement but we obviously mean two different things by it However in what follows I will use the phrase the existence of God in it s usual sense and this is the sense that I think you are using it I would like a clarification upon what you mean by the existence of God We also might differ upon what it means to have faith Here is what Webster says faith 1a allegiance to duty or a person LOYALTY b 1 fidelity to one s promises 2 sincerity of intentions 2a 1 belief and trust in and loyalty to God 2 belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b 1 firm belief in something for which there is no proof 2 complete trust 3 something that is believed esp with strong conviction esp a system of religious beliefs syn see BELIEF One can never prove that God does or does not exist When you say that you believe God does not exist and that this is an opinion based upon observation I will have to ask what observtions are you refering to There are NO observations pro or con that are valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief All observations can only point you in a direction a direction that we might even be predisposed to by predisposed I mean for example people whoes partents believe in God also tend to To actually draw a conclusion about the existence or non existence of God requires a leap and you have made this leap when you actively say I believe that God does does not exist Personally I think that both statements are misguided Arguing over the existence of God is precisely the wrong way to find Him and yes I use Him because a personal God is the only viable concept IMO if a person wants to use She go ahead Of course God is neither He nor She but we have no choice but to anthropomorphise If you want me to explain myself further I ll be glad to And please if someone does not agree with me even if they violently disagree it s in no ones advantage to start name calling If a person thinks I ve misunderstood something in

for the BusLogic cards is not included with OS 2 2 0 any longer If you wish to install the beta from the CD ROM you will need to REM out the Adaptec device drivers as they have a nasty tendency to crash the BusLogic cards when OS 2 attempts to use them Thanks Adaptec So you add the BusLogic drivers to the config sys on the CD ROM boot disk and REM out the Adaptec drivers Then you install the whole 1st half of the Beta and it won t work IBM nicely copies in the Adaptec drivers once again Thanks IBM So REM out the Adaptec drivers once more and reboot If you have everything in the right order it will work Things are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation except OS 2 will try to install the Adaptec SCSI drivers once again at the end so you are off to more REM statements and more fun The BT 542Bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the Adaptec cards that do not come with drivers The DOS drivers work great This card can easily be configured to work with 8

However just in case something went wrong I m going to describe some of the changes needed to get Windows 3 1 working with the 1542 Also you may have noticed that installing Windows 3 1 makes your PC run much slower even when you re not running Windows methods of speeding it up are discussed in the section called Windows 3 1 runs slowly MSDOS configuration The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your CONFIG SYS and AUTOEXEC BAT files If you follow the instructions you ll notice that you ll need to use double buffering with SmartDrive this is the default setup You ll also notice that your system runs much much slower in both Windows AND MSDOS See the section called Windows 3 1 runs slowly for some ways of speeding your system up Windows configuration To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows make sure that the 388Enh section of the SYSTEM INI file contains the entry VirtualHDIRQ Off I believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry to SYSTEM INI but I m not sure If this doesn t work for you you might want to try adding some more lines VirtualHDIRQ Off SystemROMBreakPoint false EMMExclude A000 CFFF You probably don t need the above lines though The SystemROMBreakPoint entry is used to enable support for memory managers like QEMM 386MAX only needed if you use such programs Windows 3 1 runs slowly Once you do get Windows 3 1 running with the 1542 chances are that your system is running much slower than before If it s not it s probably because 1 You happen to be using ASPI4DOS SYS version 3 1 in your CONFIG SYS file Congratulations this appears to be a winning solution 2 You are very lucky Whether your luck will hold out remains to be seen If your system is running much slower than before this is almost definitely caused by Smartdrive with double buffering According to the Windows documentation and the Microsoft technical note Q81808 SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS SYS you must use Smartdrive with double buffering enabled While this works it really slows down your PC I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a factor of 5 FIVE As I consider this unacceptable I looked for other solutions Unfortunately you cannot just disable double buffering If you do Windows 3 1 in enhanced mode will not work and you might even destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3 1 What you can do is one of the following 1 Use other drivers that provide double buffering It is my opinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused either by horribly inefficient double buffering or by a bug in Smartdrive 2 Use a driver that provides VDS services VDS stands for Virtual DMA Services This is a standard which is supported by Windows 3 1 that allows bus mastering disk controllers like the 1542 to work with Windows After trashing my hard disk countless times I found the following solutions none of which require using Smartdrive note however that I am now getting occasional parity errors which are probably NOT caused by these solutions but might be see below While the following does not require Smartdrive using some kind of disk cache utility is strongly recommended as this makes Windows run much much faster 1 If you do not have the ASPI4DOS SYS driver or you do not need ASPI functions for controlling a CDROM tape drive more than two physical hard disks etc you can add the SCSIHA SYS driver to your CONFIG SYS file e g DRIVER c CSIHA SYS V386 Windows needs the V386 option This driver MUST be loaded into LOW memory it cannot be loaded into high memory and it occupies about 16 20K As of November 1992 the SCSIHA SYS driver could be obtained from the Adaptec BBS at 408 945 7727 hopefully it s still there 2 If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS SYS driver version 3 0 or 3 0a you can use both the ASPI4DOS SYS and SCSIHA SYS drivers in your CONFIG SYS file e g DRIVER c SPI4DOS SYS DRIVER c CSIHA SYS V386 Amazingly enough the SCSIHA SYS driver can also be loaded high assuming you have DOS 5 0 I would have thought that this would crash my system but it doesn t I asked Adaptec s technical support about this and they said that loading SCSIHA SYS high should be fine as long as ASPI4DOS SYS is loaded LOW On my system NOT using SCSIHA SYS with ASPI4DOS 3 0a would occasionally cause Windows 3 1 to crash upon restarting or exiting Windows with the additional result of a corrupted disk some of my C INDOWS GRP files would be corrupted For me these crashes usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN EXE the default Windows shell and vice versa This is the reason SCSIHA SYS may be necessary I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA SYS is necessary with versions of ASPI4DOS earlier than 3 0 Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3 0 or 3 0a without SCSIHA SYS they do not seem to have any problems at all I consider these people lucky Others like me have had all sorts of problems 3 In my opinion the best but not necessarily the easiest solution is to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3 1 The SCSIHA SYS driver is no longer needed Unfortunately while you could get previous ASPI4DOS upgrades from the Adaptec BBS the ASPI4DOS 3 1 driver is not available from the Adaptec BBS As far as I know there are only three ways to get a copy You can buy the new as of November 1992 Adaptec EZ SCSI driver kit which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3 1 as well as other drivers such as CDROM drivers I believe the list price is around 75 If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS you can supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for around 30 A copy of ASPI4DOS 3 1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8 0 for MSDOS Note that the documentation and driver are stored in different directories Note further that only ASPI4DOS is included the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two hard disks are not included This is where I obtained my copy of ASPI4DOS 3 1 Note however that I am now getting occasional parity errors with Windows In all probability defective hardware in my PC is causing this as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above solutions However because these parity errors occur only during disk accesses there is a very small but definite possibility that the parity errors are driver related for example changing the bus on off timing for certain disk transfers might cause this I ve run various memory tests for hours at a time and these tests have found no problems This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal timing requirements which cause parity errors during disk transfers this is why the memory tests didn t find any problems the problems show up only under disk I O However I m mentioning this just in case it isn t a hardware problem Floppy controller based tape backup devices There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a floppy controller based tape backup device such as the Colorado Memory Systems Jumbo 250 1 Tape backups restores can take a very long time The tape drive constantly starts stops starts stops etc 2 Tape operations may be erratic or encounter too many tape errors This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542 However I ve heard of other people having similar problems and so I m mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my 1542 Tape backups restores take a long time If you have a floppy controller based tape backup device you may have to adjust the Adaptec 1540 1542 bus on off timing for best results when using the tape drive Normally while doing a tape backup or restore the tape drive motor should be continuously running with only an occasional pause However the default bus timing on the Adaptec 1540 1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop start and stop every few seconds This causes needless wear to the tape and tape drive however note that a dirty tape head or a defective tape drive can also cause this make sure your tape heads are clean This also causes the tape backup or restore to take much much longer than necessary The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to transfer data in memory to from the tape drive and the Adaptec uses DMA to transfer data in memory to from the hard disk The floppy DMA needs to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate if the tape drive is not fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA the tape drive stops rewinds a bit and restarts once enough data is eventually fed to it The default bus timing on the Adaptec which is really DMA timing is too large For example when a backup is done data has to be transferred from a hard disk to memory and then from memory to the tape Because the default timing on the Adaptec hogs the memory too much too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to memory not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the tape drive As a result the tape drive constantly starts and stops because data is not fed to it quickly enough The solution is to change the Adaptec s bus on off timing The default factory setting is 11 microseconds on and 5 microseconds off The bus on timing needs to be lowered to 2 4 microseconds This can be done in one of two ways If you have ASPI4DOS you can use the n option For example I use a bus on timing of 4 microseconds which means that I use the following line in my CONFIG SYS file DEVICE c spi4dos sys n4 Note that there is NO space between the n and the 4 If you don t have ASPI4DOS your only recourse is to try to find a program called SETSCSI EXE which is very difficult to find The reason is that Adaptec for reasons of their own does not seem to want this widely distributed I once asked someone who worked for Adaptec and they asked me to not upload it anywhere If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet you could try using archie to hunt down a copy I believe that there are a couple of sites that have it If you do find a copy you run it like so setscsi n 4 This adjusts the bus on timing to 4 microseconds Running SETSCSI EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the factory defaults Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI EXE if you use ASPI4DOS SETSCSI EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded I could use SETSCSI EXE with SCSIHA SYS however Do not lower the bus on timing below 2 microseconds or increase it above 11 microseconds If you lower it too low the hard disk throughput will suddenly drop your system will feel slower For me 4 microseconds works fine This value may work fine for you or you may have to adjust it downwards a little Once you ve lowered the bus on timing tape backups and restores should run faster Also do not experiment with the bus on off times with the other options that I have intentionally not described unless you know what you are doing Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse by starving memory refresh A program called BUSTIFIX EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS Unless this has been upgraded since I last checked which has been a while this is a self extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple of other files This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the bus on off times for the 1540 1542 and others However when I tried running this program with my 1542A my system crashed At the time I was running SCSIHA SYS and I didn t check to see if there was a conflict with it Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B although the docs say that it works with the 1542A Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors This problem may or may not exist Although it existed on my system a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it However I ve heard of other people having similar problems and so I m mentioning this just in case it isn t a hardware problem just on my 1542 Symptoms of this problem which persists even after cleaning the tape head 1 Backing up to tape encounters unusable sector detected errors resulting in an aborted tape backup 2 Tape backup works but the tape compare fails 3 The tape drive starts stops starts stops etc much too often Unlike the above mentioned problem Tape backups restores take a long time where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds this kind of starting stopping occurs every few 10 20 seconds or so 4 Fastback Plus 3 1 does not find see any tape backup devices Other programs like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive can find see the tape drive but Fastback Plus 3 1 cannot 5 Too many tape read errors Although I do not know what is causing this problem I discovered that using a different floppy controller solves it A few months ago I upgraded my motherboard which contained an integrated floppy controller As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542 I initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller After a while I decided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on the motherboard When I did this the tape drive a CMS Jumbo 250 reliability increased dramatically and Fastback Plus 3 1 was suddenly able to find and use the tape drive I don t know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542 On the one hand the floppy drives worked great when they were attached to the 1542 which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the 1542 On the other hand the tape drive didn t work well attached to the 1542 floppy controller but it did work when attached to a different controller this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my 1542 I did change floppy drive cables and so it is conceivable that the problem was in the cables I don t know what the cause really is however if you re having similar problems you might want to consider trying a new floppy controller Sound cards Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound and this is typically done using DMA Like the tape drive DMA the Adaptec s DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA Unlike that of the tape DMA this conflict usually manifests itself as a parity error your system crashes with a parity error message What happens is that data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the Adaptec memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough which causes a parity error Usually getting a parity error means that there is a hardware problem with your system in this case however the parity error is not a symptom of bad hardware I ve found that such parity errors typically occur while recording digitized sound and the chances of such errors increase as you increase the recording fidelity e g higher sampling rate recording in stereo recording using 16 bits instead of 8 etc Like the tape drive solution the solution here is to lower the Adaptec s bus on timing See the section on tape drives for information on how this is done Note however that this may or may not solve the problem it may only reduce the probability of a parity error The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect this problem i e some software is inefficient Disk caches the speed of your hard disk and the amount of disk fragmentation can also affect this Miscellaneous info This section contains miscellaneous hints tips and rumors Much of it is merely information that I ve heard or read about and have not verified I believe that the following information is correct but I m not sure Use it at your own risk With QEMM 6 00 6 01 and 6 02 you need to specify the DB parameter e g DB 2 unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver If you don t QEMM will crash hang at bootup Although the QEMM manual mentions this the install program does not seem to detect that a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM command line at least this occurred with the QEMM 6 00 install program I haven t tested any other version Earlier versions of QEMM probably need this parameter but I m not sure I ve never used a version earlier than 6 00 If you use ASPI4DOS you do not need to give QEMM the DB parameter Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one gigabyte in size To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB you need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec I m not sure if this is still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542 you need a SCSI CDROM drive and some drivers Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces non SCSI these drives cannot be used with the 1542 You have three choices for CDROM drivers I have no idea how well the following solutions work or even if they work the following is secondhand information 1 You can buy Adaptec s EZ SCSI driver package which lists for something like 75 If you already have older Adaptec drivers you can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around 30 Contact Adaptec for details The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains everything that you need 2 You can buy the CorelSCSI driver package which is made by the same people that make CorelDRAW This package contains CDROM drivers SCSI tape drivers WORM drivers etc I do not know the list price but I ve seen this package sold for around 80 90 Note that CorelSCSI does not come with the ASPI4DOS driver which is needed If you do not already have ASPI4DOS you may be better off getting Adaptec s EZ SCSI instead 3 This method is obsolete as the following drivers have been obsoleted by Adaptec s EZ SCSI kit but I m mentioning it in case someone already has these drivers You can use the drivers in the Adaptec ASW 1410 kit ASPI4DOS and the ASW 410 kit ASPI CDROM drivers You will have to get a copy of MSCDEX EXE a high level CDROM driver if it is not included in the ASW 410 kit but this is available from several bulletin boards To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542 you need software that knows how to talk to a SCSI tape drive Software that I ve heard about are again like the above section on CDROM drives I have no idea how well the following solutions work or even if they work the following is secondhand information 1 Central Point PC Tools 8 0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large number of SCSI tape drives It comes with SCSI drivers ASPI4DOS 3 1 as well as Central Point Backup 2 The CorelSCSI driver package contains a SCSI tape backup program see the above section on CDROM drives for more details However note that CorelSCSI does not come with but requires ASPI4DOS I ve seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations 1 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS 2 1542 SCSI controller w BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers 3 1542 SCSI controller w BIOS Adaptec ASPI drivers and CorelSCSI drivers programs I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration 4 1542 SCSI controller w BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers including ASPI drivers Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver you need this driver before you can use this program I ve never used this version of GNU tar but I ve heard that it works I don t know how well though If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet a copy can be found

XPutImage is considerably slower factor of 2 on average than the Sunview command pw_rop which moves image data from memory pixrects to a canvas This was on a Sparc IPX It seems that 1 the X protocol communication is slowing things down or 2 XPutImage is inefficient or both Using XPutImage your source is maintained by the client and the destination is maintained by the server thus you incur the overhead of transporting through whatever client server communications mechanism you are using Is it possible for you to maintain your source images in pixmaps These are maintained by the server so copying them into a window is much cheaper Also make sure you are not sending any unnecessary XSyncs or running in XSynchonize mode If you need speed and your client can run on the same host as the X server you should use the shared memory extension to the sample X server MIT SHM xdpyinfo will tell you if your server has this extension This is certainly available with the sample MIT X server running under SunOS A word of warning make sure your kernel is configured to support shared memory And another word of warning OpenWindows is slower than the MIT server I have written an imaging tool using XView for the GUI by the way which yields over 10 frames per second for 512 512 8 bit images running on a Sparc IPC half the cpu grunt of an IPX This has proved quite sufficient for animations

John Martin writes Animation is most frequently done by copying the the client resident XImages into server resident Pixmap s using XPutImage Once this is done the original XImages can be deleted and the animation loop can be performed using XCopyArea from the Pixmaps to the windows drawable Hope this is helpfull John I just implemented this and it seems I can just about achieve the display rates 20 400x400x8 frames sec on IPX that I get with Sunview though it s a bit choppy at times Also loading the data making an XImage then XPut ing it into a pixmap is a bit cumbersome so the animation is slower to load than with Sunview Is there a better way to load in the data Richard Gooch writes If you need speed and your client can run on the same host as the X server you should use the shared

was FREE BOOK OF MORMON Organization Hewlett Packard Boise Idaho X Newsreader TIN version 1 1 4 PL6 Lines 83 Robert Weiss wrote lots of stuff about the Nicene Creed deleted which can be read in the original basenote I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to take Mr Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine Hopefully the LDS netters will be amiable in their explanation Since it would do no good to rebut what Mr Weiss has stated on the origin of the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired I say no good because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not the authors of the Creed were inspired I leave you it will be some time before I post again with the following thought authored by Eugene England Professor of English at Brigham Young University Mr England wrote the following as part of a book review section in This People s magazine Spring 1993 edition I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon or human family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other with terms like feminist or patriarchal liberal or conservative Christian or non Christian Hal 8 When we are tempted to draw a circle around a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American then exclude those who don t fit it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central defining characteristic of a good American might be one who doesn t draw exclusive circles that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the central American ideal is by excluding others And when we are tempted to draw a circle around Mormon or Christian to decide who is orthodox and who isn t by how much they agree with us it might be well to consider that the central pillar of Christ s orthodoxy is our ability to love unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family I recently spent some time in a Christian bookstore in California The service was excellent the clerks and customers all smiling neat and well scrubbed and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural commentaries sentimental fiction and collections of evangelistic sermons But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking others often viciously whether the political left our modern American culture or other religions A whole section was devoted to Cults and the Occult and as you might expect Mormonism was right there under the same rubric and indictment often by the same authors as Satanism And I found I could either rent or buy in English or Spanish copies of The God Makers that absurdly inaccurate even libelous but very popular and dangerous anti Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety Perfect love casteth out fear I John 4 18 I have always been pleased that the LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths though I find a disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating and even threats of coercive action as the religious right wing has launched this year against the political left and American cultural and religious styles they don t like It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons people who would if they had power forcefully restrict Mormons rights along with those of others they believe to be evil The above sermon was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe to This People s magazine but would certainly apply to all of us who rely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His arms Even though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles of the restored gospel as in the days of Christ the Church does not claim perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do now lead the Church I for one do not wish to be labelled Christian if those who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are intollerent for example of the way my religion may interpret Biblical scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication than mainstream Christianity would give it Once again being in the majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective voice is louder That s really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand on in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter the LDS Church interpretation Using someone elses biased research of truths and non truths whose to say what the mixture is as an authoritative tool to disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone least of all themselves Let us simply agree to

want to be able to print to it from our SGI iris network The copier printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface I have configured the printer with the lp system using the parallel interface and can print postscript files to the printer I can also print rgb files but these are in turn converted to postscript by an internal filter The Canon CLC 500 is a publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts are less than acceptable We create the postscript files with a variaty of programs such as showcase xv and tops When we convert to postscript with tops and use the l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98 rather than the default 40 the output is better but still much less that acceptable Note that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format and translating the image into postscript We suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality pictures We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the SCSI port To my knowledge this software is 5000 and does not come with a warranty The management here does not want to spend this much money without some assurance that the product will work Here my

Easter The objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it Easter or Eashtar or Ishtar or Ishtarti or other spellings is the pagan whore goddess of fertility Therefore your question to me is what is the objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess When phrased that way I suspect or at least I would HOPE that it becomes immeadiately apparent what my objection to celebrating her would be It is celebration of the resurrection of Jesus No you are thinking perhaps of Ressurection Sunday I think Though I m not too crazy about the word Sunday but I certainly like this phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess For that matter stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet The Feast of First Fruits Torah commands that this be observed on the day following the Sabbath of Passover week Sunday by any other name in modern parlance Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured Why jump it all over the calendar the way Easter does Why not just go with the Sunday following Passover the way the Bible has it Why seek after unbiblical methods I don t recall a command in Scripture for us to celebrate the resurrection but it is the sole and only reason that we are Christians how could we not celebrate it So what does this question have to do with Easter the whore goddess I am all for celebrating the Resurrection Just keep that whore out of the discussion If it is only the name which is a problem I suggest that if we are too concerned about etymology there are a lot of words we are going to have to drop As an aside some terminally PC people here in Ottawa want dictionaries to be altered so that there are no negative definitions associated with the word _black_ so as not to offend people of colour Yes I have heard of your newspapers speaking of the need to repave streets with Afro Canadiantop grin I still think blacktop sounds better though As a short person I hope they will also remove the definition curt or surly associated with my physical description Fine by me And while we are at it the left handed people are both sinister and gauche so we probably will have some objections from that quarter as well In Quebec French the word for the celebration of the resurrection is Pa ques this is etymologically related to Pesach Passover and the pascal lamb So is the French Canadian mostly Roman Catholic celebration better because it uses the right name Yes that sounds much better to me Is there anyone out there would thinks that phrasing sounds worse So from this I infer that there are different rules for Christians of Jewish descent What happened to there is neither Jew nor Greek slave nor free male nor female for all are one in Christ Jesus Read the letter to Philemon Now tell me was Philemon s slave returned to him Were there different rules upon the slave than upon Philemon How about male and female Are there different rules that apply to them as well Or if there is no more male and female can Adam and Steve get married to each other in your congregation Yes there are differences in form and function But the way we come to Salvation in Messiah remains the same no matter what our position in life I am in general not in favor of continuing this discussion as it seems repetitive but this particular point is one that I believe is new the objection is not to having a holiday but to its name I d like to suggest that people think very carefully about this argument Words often change their meaning over time The days of the week are of course originally based on pagan gods Some Christians prefer to refer to first day second day etc However the majority of Christians have not been persuaded The question seems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary shows as the derivation of a word if what people mean by it and think when they use it is different Indeed I d like to suggest that postings like this could themselves be dangerous Suppose people in general use Easter to mean the celebration of Christ s resurrection Postings trying to convince them that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run the risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose They are doing their best to create a linkage in people s minds between their celebration and the pagan goddess It s not clear that this is a healthy thing clh']"

12k the Honda was 500 over while the SC2 at the same price was excluded In other words they let the best Honda play but not the best Saturn Note that the Saturn did beat the 13k I dont know about the car comparison but as far as the price goes rest assured that the street prices for the MX 3 and Escort and maybe even the Honda will be lesser than that of the Saturn you re talking about All price

Yes But the point is that prices are competetive Saturn may well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a 2000 profit but since a comperable Honda with 500 profit is more expensive it may be well worth it to buy the Saturn Moreover if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by 1000 then their cars will be even better deals Say if the price of a Saturn was already 1000 below market average for the class of cars then after they reduce the dealer profit it would be 2000 below market average It will 1 Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY 2 Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive Now not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit even the buyers for other cars will pay less Not necessarily It seems to me that Saturn salesdroids who don t make a commision whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally do make more per hour or whatever This means that Saturn doesn t give up the profit to

minor changes to the Motif bindings Imake support has been improved a few defaults have been changed and a lot of other small things have been added This is basically a release which drops the gamma status Next release will incorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz and possibly will support X11R5 and Motif 1 2 x Note to all of those who keep copies of the archive please retrieve this distribution during off peak hours and delete all previous copies Here is the original ANNOUNCEMENT HISTORY The University of Lowell supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation has developed a wrapper library that encapsulates Motif widgets in C classes All resources of these Widgets can now be set through member functions while objects can be used in callback functions The library was made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129 63 1 1 However the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights and only worked under X11R3 Due to lack of subsequent fundings the bindings are no longer actively supported by the University of Lowell I Ronald van Loon at a certain point last year have taken the Lowell bindings fixing the bugs I came across adding missing memberfunctions and enhancing functionality and made the bug fixed library available for the general public for anonymous ftp made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC NEW RELEASE I am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif bindings This release offers Full Motif1 1 and X11R4 support Support for Xbae widgetset Two additional widgets written by myself that can be used to indicate progress in an application Imake support NB this release relies heavily on the existence of imake and its config files on your site I have tried to provide the bindings with a standard Makefile tweakable for those unfortunates without imake I have not severely tested the standard Makefile though Contact me if you have problems The reason for calling this a gamma release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude of platforms to test the Imake files on Lots of testfiles even somewhat useful programs An article I wrote on the usage of Motif X and C previously posted on Usenet

recent announcement I m sure you ll see it on virtually every workstation ie Sun IBM HP and DEC must make up the VAST majority of all hardware I am also concerned by this prevalence of Motif particularly from the point of view of writing and obtaining free software As the Linux and 386BSD communities grow however I think that Motif will lose some of its grip at least in the non commercial marketplace Ports of Motif to both 386BSD and Linux are available for a fee of about 100 This is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to redistribute The activity in both the BSD and Linux news groups pertaining to Motif has been high I just wonder if this will also cause a divergence between commercial and non commercial software ie you will only get free software using Athena or OpenLook widget sets and only get commercial software using the Motif widget sets I can t see why If just about every workstation will come with Motif by default and you can buy it for under 100 for the free UNIX platforms I can t see this causing major problems Side Note All the X based code I am writing and will distribute freely when completed is based on Motif because from a programmatic and

hence I am limited to using whatever X libraries the Motif port was compiled against at least with older versions of Motif I have been told that Motif 1 2 can be used with any X but I have not seen it myself Currently I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms of which only three came with Motif On those three I am unable to use the X11R5 libraries to build Motif clients because I get link errors between the vendor supplied port of Motif and my X11R5 I anticipate having this same problem when X11R6 becomes available The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5

up the apparatus These papers demonstrate that the auras obtained by Kirlian photography can be completely explained by the effect of the electric currents used on the moisture in the object being photographed It has nothing to do with the energy signature of organic objects I did a science project on Kirlian photography when I was in high school I was able to obtain wonderful auras from rocks

Nntp Posting Host bambam Reply To Paul Martz Organization Evans Sutherland Computer Corp Salt Lake City UT Lines 50 In article Jeffrey C Gealow writes I m working on an X11R5 application and have concerns regarding standard colormaps The X11R5 documentation says Usually a window manager creates these colormaps I wonder what window manager the writer had in mind Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps Standard colormaps were spec d with the intention that window managers would make them available This doesn t mean that every window manager author in the world immediately dropped everything they were doing and implemented this at top priority The ESGE server we ship makes the XA_RGB_BEST_MAP available at startup It doesn t wait for window managers to do it Of course one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps However xstdcmap doesn t seem to try very hard to avoid conflicts with the default colormap When I use standard colormaps created by xstdcmap the rest of my display goes black So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid Perhaps if every application used standard colormaps things would be wonderful But not many applications seem to use standard colormaps Does your hardware have only one CLUT Since standard colormaps typically devour all 256 entries there is no way it can avoid displacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one CLUT I don t believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible colormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap Rather colormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the same standard colormap An example would be two clients that need a full color range would both use XA_RGB_BEST_MAP or whatever it s called under X11R5 If you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default colormap your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into that colormap If you can t do that then you ll get flashing on a one hw CLUT framebuffer Now if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your client this flashing could also be avoided Perhaps some window managers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps paul Evans Sutherland', 'From Bram Subject Creating 8 bit windows on 24 bit display How Organization FWI University of Amsterdam Lines 75

are many in some cases conflicting statutes on the books I was merely suggesting a paradigm that might make sense for a pro choicer IMHO And I was pointing out that legal precedent defines a human being as referring only to the born so your suggestion was incorrect If at some point an unborn child is a human being the parents clearly have the same responsibilities toward her as any other parents have toward their children And no parent can be forced to supply bodily resources toward their children even if necessary to save the child s life There is a confusion here between action and inaction a parent does not have to run out in front of a bus to save their child s life either but a parent IS required to feed his children There is a confusion here about what bodily resources

people such as yourself confuse a discussion of mental health related to Jane Doe who was in a mental institution and attempt to claim that this same argument could be applied to a woman who decided she wanted an abortion because she was having a bad hair day As you well know the facts are that there are about 100 third trimester abortions performed in this country annually and those are only done for serious health reasons Larry Margolis Bitnet Internet Hmmm Human gestation period is something like 39 weeks That means third trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks In consulting a 1989 World Almanac I see that 1 of abortions in 1983 were done at 21 weeks or more That s about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks Unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically or a LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks I think you are wrong By the way Roe v Wade allowed states to adopt very very broad prohibitions on third trimester abortions but some states such as California declined to do so It was reported that what finally stopped third trimester elective abortions in the Bay Area wasn t law but that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses then doctors willing to do them Not surprisingly the bay area NOW chapter was terribly upset about this I remain pro choice but when pro choicers compare abortion in a clinic to a religious ritual in

to be heard by patients inside the clinic Several years ago Justice William O Douglas who was about as libertarian as you can get about free speech and similar issues wrote a majority opinion in which the Supreme Court turned down an appeal by a group of people who had been prohibited from demonstrating in front of their landlord s home Do you have a cite for the case You don t give enough information to be able to compare the two situations If the demonstrators had been blaring loud rock music into the landlord s home all day and night then I could see how the opinion would be justified But this court order had prohibited abortion protesters from displaying pictures of dead fetuses which doesn t disrupt the privacy of anyone inside the clinic He pointed out that people have a right to be free _from_ speech Perhaps in the privacy of their homes but not on public property Did the Korean grocery store owner in New York city have a right to be free from the speech of the protesters outside his store Patrons inside the store could hear the protesters asking them to re consider shopping there how is that different from the abortion protesters asking women to re consider getting an abortion at a clinic Harassment goes beyond expression to direct attack on particular persons in this case the workers and clients at a clinic Its purpose is clearly not to convey information or express an opinion but to intimidate and do harm to other others Even if the protesters speech could be considered harassment which it is not hate speech laws have generally been struck down by the courts I don t see how the words don t kill your baby or abortion is murder could be considered harassment Anti abortionists have lost the battle for public opinion and the more

1 fix 5 is in four parts you need to request 5a 5b 5c and 5d separately 2 the file sunGX uu which was part of an earlier patch was re released with patch 7 note the file doesn t work with Solaris 3

fix 19 also needs PEXlib tar Z which you can obtain from xstuff by asking for PEXlib uu 1234 8 fix 22 is in 9 parts 22a through 22i Subject 59 What is the xstuff mail archive The xstuff server is a mail response program That means that you mail it a request and it mails back the response Any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line The xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything so you can have several different commands in a single message unless you ask for help The xstuff server treats the Subject header line just like any other line of the message The archives are organized into a series of directories and subdirectories Each directory has an index and each subdirectory has an index The top level index gives you an overview of what is in the subdirectories and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it 1 The command help or send help causes the server to send you a more detailed version of this help file 2 if your message contains a line whose first word is index then the server will send you the top level index of the contents of the archive If there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories then the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top level index For example you can say send index fixes or index fixes A message that requests an index cannot request data 3 if your message contains a line whose first word is send then the xstuff server will send you the item s named on the rest of the line To name an item you give its directory and its name For example send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9 You may issue multiple send requests The xstuff server contains many safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large amounts of data The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of data each day If the work queue contains more requests than the day s quota then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day Whenever the mailer is run to send its day s quota it sends the requests out shortest first 4 Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting return addresses If you use such a mailer you won t get any response If you happen to know an explicit path you can include a line like path or path bar foo frotz in the body of your message and the daemon will use it The xstuff

The World Public Access UNIX Brookline MA Lines 64 In article Gordon Banks writes In article John Werner writes In article Gordon Banks wrote Explain I thought there were 3 types of cones equivalent to RGB You re basically right but I think there are just 2 types One is sensitive to red and green and the other is sensitive to blue and yellow This is why the two most common kinds of color blindness are red green and blue yellow Yes I remember that now Well in that case the cones are indeed color sensitive contrary to what the original respondent had claimed I m not sure who the original respondent was but to reiterate cones respond to particular portions of the spectrum just as _rods_ respond to certain parts of the visible spectrum bluegreen in our case reddish in certain amphibia just as the hoseshoe crab _Limulus polyphemus_ photoreceptors respond to a certain portion of the spectrum etc It is a common misconception to confound wavelength specificity with being color sensitive however the two are not synonymous So in sum and to beat a dead horse 1 When the outputs of a cone are matched for number of absorbed photons _irrespective_ of the absorbed photons wavelength the cone outputs are _indistinguishable_ 2 Cones are simply detectors with different spectral sensitivities and are not any more color sensitive than are rods ommatidia or other photoreceptors 3 Color vision arises because outputs of receptors which sample different parts of the spectrum cones in this case are processed centrally The handwave is intentional I ve worked and published research on rods and cones for over 10 years so the adherence to the belief that cones can detect color is frustrating But don t take my word for it I m reposting a few excellent articles

Buddy I do not have DD Gold 6 0 experience I just ordered it I currently have DD 2 3 the last version I am very pleased with its performance Here is my suggestion 1 If you do not have any compression

more than 50 for Besides you are now at DOS6 0 whatever that means 2 If you have DoubleDisk 2 3 already like I do the cost is 29 95 for the upgrade After thinking about it and asking the net I decided that I could not go wrong with the update cost I have never suffered from performance of DD I have a 12ms HD with large SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format It works great Not delays I think the A is better than B arguements are a lot of bunk they are all comparable in performance I am looking forward to being able to LOADHIGH the DD sw That has been an annoyance 3 If you have Stacker et al currently I would not see it worth the effort to upgrade Just my 02 Regards Mark Bagdy Buddy I got the same mailer About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it The documentation was in my opinion easy to follow I used the automatic installation not the custom and everything went smoothly There were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max QEMM DDG has an uninstall unlike DOS6 0 if you need it My system has a 203Mb hard drive before installing DDG I had 5Mb free After DDG I had 197Mb free Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows swap file stayed on the uncompressed portion along with other drivers and such I have had no problems whatsoever I have noticed no slowdown other than it takes a little longer to boot either in windows or dos So far I am a very happy camper Bruce Bruce F Steinke Never know when you re going to need a good piece of rope Software Technical Support Engineer Sam Gamgee Evans Sutherland Computer

that the speed of a DoubleDisk drive with a drive read cache is about equal to the bare drive without a cache I have no complaints about reliability It was very easy to install The only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3 D I assumed the game was trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non compressed region of the disk Since then the game has never given me a problem There was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive Compression performance for the whole disk has held steady around 1 8 1 This is lower than expected but about 20 size of my files are compressed

C 5s and C 141s that are getting extremely old If you read Aviation Week the C 5 line can be reopened and the C 5s would be delivered a year earlier and cost a billion less for the program Politically

Agreed Congress took money from NASA and FHA to fund the second Seawolf The shipyards are still building Los Angeles Class submarines and there is a lack of ASW foes to contend with The Navy is considering reducing the number of attack subs to 40 Navy Times and that would entail getting rid of or mothballing some of the current Los Angeles class Politically General Dynamics is in Connecticut and we will get Seawolf subs whether we need them or not In addition more bases need to be closed Probably Long Beach Naval Station and others The Navy is talking about three main bases on each coast

actually reflected better two way play In my opinion Francis s low is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times the fact that he can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team s top center is a testament to how valuable he is even if his suffers On the other hand Jagr for how big fast and skilled he is can t even get 90 points no matter how

Desiree Bradley asked us whether we should think of the Serbs as doing God s work in Bosnia I ve refrained from posting in hope that someone who is more familiar with the OT than I would answer But at this point I feel I have to say something Many things about this posting bother me I know of not the slightest suggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the Gospel and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death of Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel Christ died to break down these distinctions In him there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither slave nor free there is neither male nor female If Moslems do not know him we may preach to them but we don t kill them Furthermore the attack is between states not religions There are Christians being attacked as well One of the towns under attack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are living together peacefully The precedents being suggested are from the OT There are in fact two different things being alluded to The first is from the entry into Canaan For that to be a parallel we would need for God to have promised this land through a prophet And we would need the war to be a holy war There were tight constraints on behavior in those attacks Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be defeated Rape would not have been tolerated While the accounts in Joshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed note that it was possible for a town to make peace with the Israelites and that once that was done even when deception was involved they were expected to honor it In contrast there have been many violations of agreement in this incident I see no evidence that God has granted Bosnia to the Serbs as a promised land and if he had their behavior would have disqualified this from being a holy war The other OT parallel is from later when Israel was defeated by Assyria and Babylonia The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel for her sins Someone asks whether we shouldn t see this as a judgement on the Bosnians for their sins This sounds like a replay of the old claim that we shouldn t have doctors or hospitals because illness is God s judgement Yes even bad things may be used by God for good That includes actions of bad people But that doesn t justify them If you read the prophets you find them very clear that in attacking Israel the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as unintentional agents of God Their intent was to attack God s people and they would be judged for it The fact that they were actually carrying out

because the AMA and the CMA are interlinked organizations and he would not have done it without the approval of his AMA cronies Well yeah tell us about the National Defense Medical Centre outside Ottawa Theoretically it s limited to service personnel but some studies I ve heard about have suggested that about half the patients there are civilians who not only have connections but aren t urgent at all It serves the same purpose as the Bethesda Naval Hospital since not all hospitals can provide everything maybe they have some stuff that others don t Ottawa s population is only a quarter

money on other things than the health insurance Our high taxes are high for other spending but health insurance which is separate and optional and it is being spent in a nonpartisan manner by every

obligation to Of course they could eventually make money again but if what you say is true they d be loathe to do so and out of practice in handling such basic services too Some of the companies providing extra insurance are subsidiaries of American companies and their parents provide full insurance down here Regardless all firms up north can easily turn on cable TV to see how well the American firms are doing by being involved in basic coverage The private firms are making too much money after having gotten rid of basic coverage They run around patting them selves on the back for

group at Livermore What you may ask does gas guns have to do with lasers Nothing really but the gun is physically located across the road from the Free Electron Laser building and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room thick walls from which the gun firings are controlled So I suspect that the office he works for is an administrative convenience I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb and we toured the gun At the time I was working on gas gun R D at Boeing where I work but I am now doing other things helping to save the space station The gun uses a methane air mixture which is burned in a chamber about 200 ft long by 16 inch ID i e it looks like a pipe The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several hundred m s down the chamber On the other side of the piston is hudrogen gas initially at room temperature andsome tens of atmospheres The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures at around 50 000 psi The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch bore It is mounted at right angles to the chamber i e they intersect This was done so that in the future the barrel could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to move the larger and heavier chamber The projectile being used in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic 4 in in diameter and about 50 cm long All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen gas from 50 000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the barrel The barrel is evacuated and the end is sealed with a sheet of plastic film a little thicker than Saran wrap The plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped in the barrel ahead of the projectile The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic water jugs In the early testing fragments of the plastic projectile were found At the higher speeds in later testing the projectile vaporizes The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is about 3 miles across and the projectile would go 100 200 km if fired for maximum range The intent is to move the whole gun to Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete where they can fire into the Pacific Ocean and use the tracking radar at VAFB to follow the projectiles The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4 km s half of orbital speed So far they have reached 2 km s and the gun is currently down for repairs as on the last test they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware I think it had to do with the methane air more detonating than burning but I haven t had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this There are people waiting to test scramjet components in this gun by firing then out of the gun into the air at Mach 12 4 km s since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8 This gun cost about 4 million to develop and is basically a proof of concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful sized payloads into space This would require on the order of 100 kg projectiles which deliver on the order of 20 kg useful payload to orbit Dani Eder Dani Eder Meridian Investment Company 205 464 2697 w 232 7467 h Rt 1 Box 188 2 Athens

using violence against them There is a problem of hatred in the church But there is also the problem of what has been called unsanctified mercy Many in the conservative churches have seen the moral breakdown in this country and the storm on the horizon and have gotten militant in the flesh This is truely sad Yet others in other churches have embraced immorality in society and have pointed to the carnality in the conservative churches to justify their actions Why don t we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people to Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away Certainly we should not use a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus But we shouldn t water down the gospel to draw people in Jesus didn t go out of His way to show only what might be considered positive

Organization University of Arizona Tucson Lines 75 Can someone cite Biblical references to homosexuality being immoral other than Leviticus So far when I ask around here I get the verses from Leviticus spouted at me but the whole rest of that book tends to be ignored by Christians haven t seen any stonings in a _long_ time Later Max Bob Muir The list was posted not long ago as I recall aside from Lev commonly cited passages are the story of Sodom Note however that this was a homosexual rape and there s no disagreement that that is wrong I take an intermediate position on this note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the Bible for its sinfulness It doesn t seem to have been known specifically for homosexuality Rather I think it was considered a cesspool of all sins However from what we know of Jewish attitudes homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action described It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about as many forms of evil in one act as possible homosexual rape of guests who were actually angels But this story is not specifically about homosexuality In the NT the clear references are all from Paul s letters In Rom 1 there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil Note that the passage isn t about homosexuality it s about idolatry Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment or at least result of idolatry There are a number of arguments over this passage It does not use the word homosexuality and it is referring to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality So it s not what I d call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality But it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway that Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards homosexuality The other passages occur in lists of sins in I Cor 6 9 and I Tim 1 10 Unfortunately it s not entirely clear what the words used here mean There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning such as wanton and that another may be specifically male prostitute Again we don t have here a precise teaching about homosexuality but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul shared the OT s negative judgement on homosexuality Jude 1 7 is sometimes cited however it s probably not relevant The context in Jude involves angels Since those who were almost raped in Sodom were angels it seems likely that strange flesh refers to intercourse with angels As you can see the NT evidence is such that people s conclusion is determined by their approach to the Bible Conservatives note that the passages from Paul s letters imply that he accepted the OT prohibition This is enough for them to regard it as having NT endorsement Liberals note that there s no specific teaching and no clear definition of what is being prohibited or why is the concern in Rom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship what exactly do the words in the lists of sins mean Thus some believe it is legitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his background and not a specific teaching of the Gospel This is an explosive topic which tends to result in long dissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words But it s clear to me that that s mostly irrelevant What it really comes down to is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they believe that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel This appears to depend upon one s reaction to the message of the Bible as a whole as well as one s perception of the needs of the church today This is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference between Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent and one where both sides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they keep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the other side will finally come to their senses That makes things very frustrating for a moderator who realizes that such an optimistic outcome is not very likely clh', 'From Subject Part 1 and part 2 re Homosexuality Lines 114 Return Path Tony I read your post it was nothing new I had seen much the same in other typical Christian anti gay sentimental literature Gay people are and will con tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates You may be unaware of all the statistica findings concerning African Americans that have been published and used by various groups to re enforce their own bias against African Americans We usually think of the KKK in these instances but there are many other groups Of course the vast majority of the public scoff at such findings and documents today but that was not always the case Fortunately African Americans had whites who supported their cause and public sentiment was eventually if not entirely turned around There was even a Civil War and anti negro sentiment increased In fact until laws were put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty much legal to discriminate against them I know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free form discrimination You may think that I have been deceived or something that is your perogative My church Christian Church Disciples of Christ openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society including gays We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation and making disciples We believe in the Lord s great commandment to Love and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed even if it is not popular to do so I really like my church for last reason the most I can find a church almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes in the commandment of Love though I m hard pressed to find many who actually sho Love but not many are willing to champion the oppressed especially within their own community I may have lost face with the greater Christian community for the unpopularity of my beliefs but so did the abolitionists against the oppression of African Americans Many were even killed and treated as runaway slaves for being nigger lovers and such I guess I ve decided the challenge is worth it In my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic story centering around failed marriages wives and husbands who are straight who have been hurt in the process etc Funny thing is I don t know of one case where the parents ex wives or even children have continued to reject their gay family member son daughter ex husband father etc after they began to take part in some form of support group like PFLAG I m apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado and am equally out0 raged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon from the Tradition Values Coalition have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner support within several 8 I believe states this coming November for more oppressive legisation against gays Perhaps you don t get it and maybe you never will Many didn t get it in the Middle Ages and the proclaimed God s will be done as they massacred thousands in witch hunts and inquisitions The message that comes through loud and clear by proponents against gay rights and against gays in general is that there is a strong dislike even hatred for gays whether you want to call it such or not it doesn t change the results The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end the final effect of posts like that of yours and Mr Hudson is that YOU have a conditional love for gays Condition Change and we ll love you This is sure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an unconditional love one that calls people just as they are Sure there are things that will naturally change and habits like alcoholism wife beating etc that need to be changed through some sort of therapy But then there are things like left handedness etc that no amount of beating it out of people is going to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to other people s expectations In the process this coerced conformity causes many people a great deal of harm especially when it is caused by people who have nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their own sense of pseuper spirituality This is sad but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change It may be unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with something very personal like sexuality a taboo subject even today but I firmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation on thier bedrooms It s funny that most straight people have successfully removed restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression as though it helps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society Gay people are not criminals Another interesting thing happened recently A very prominent charismatic church in the Silicon Valley here had two of it s pastors arrested for self admitted charges of pederasty men having sex with boys This had apparently been going on for some time a couple years but since the charges were voluntary and the church worked closely with the police so I imagine that was how they managed to downplay it in the media How could such a thing happen when the church itself has an ex gay ministry One of my friends recently told me he was approached by someone who is going through the reparitive therapy there and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for dinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry These are difficult times we live in but providing hostile environments and creating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence

run point to point encrypted speech it ll let us run speech internationally over the internet if no one stops us by getting very heavy about regulations The thought of this if the administration realised would probably scare them shitless Now of course the trick is to develop and define a standard protocol for internet speech damn fast allowing anyone who feels brave to inplement custom handheld hardware as well as us hacking it on our workstations Shouldn t be too difficult The CELP stuff is standardised we use tcp ip streams and a protocol allowing silences to be used to catch up on any net lag and also to avoid sending any data during silences ie it s not wise to be synchronised real time on each end because any net delays would add up to big voice lags As for me I m going to

193,192,13,192_pope_schism_church_catholic,"['pope', 'schism', 'church', 'catholic', 'sspx', 'archbishop', 'bishop', 'schismatic', 'bishops', 'papal']","['From Joseph H Buehler Subject Re SSPX schism Organization none Lines 182 Here is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in general and Archishop Lefebvre in particular He wrote it around 1990 The first part of the two part article was on the scandalous activities of Archbishop Weakland in this country but I cut all that And I pared down the rest to what was relevant Joe Buehler Schism and Disobedience According to St Thomas Aquinas schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the Church united to him On first sight it would appear that whatever the subjective motivation of the Archbishop as discussed above he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction However standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic If this were so as was noted at the beginning of this article it would mean that the number of American bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de Theologie Catholique The article is by Father Yves Congar who is certainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre He explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused Father Congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the Church for example Luther s rejection of the papacy Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience The Catholic Encyclopedia explains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies It adds that not every disobedience is schism in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors a denial of their divine right to command Not only does Mgr Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope s authority and his intention of never breaking away from Rome The Archbishop made his attitude clear in the July August 1989 issue of 30 Days We pray for the Pope every day Nothing has changed with the consecrations last June 30 We are not sedevacantists We recognize in John Paul II the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church We don t even say that he is a heretical Pope We only say that his Modernist actions favor heresy Intrinsically Schismatic The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr Lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act A bishop who carries out such a consecration it is claimed becomes ipso facto a schismatic This is not true If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication In the 1917 Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension see Canon 2370 of the 1917 Code Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in China The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr Lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope that is to deny that he has the right to govern the Church and the illicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations I do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by Mgr Lefebvre The consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman Pontiff But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the Church could not be more grave and that grave measures were needed in response It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop s critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism and the Vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression There is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation The New Code of Canon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled Penalties for Specific Offenses De Poenis in Singula Dicta The first part deals with Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the Church De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem Canon 1364 deals with the offense of schism which is evidently together with apostasy and heresy one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the Church But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or indeed under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church The canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of Penalties for Specific Offenses which is entitled Usurpation of Ecclesial Functions and Offenses in their Exercise De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum Usurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis The canon in question is Canon 1382 which reads A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic latae sententiae excommunication reserved to the Holy See The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense of schism are then contrary to both truth and charity A comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages An accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law Canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for Mgr Lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable Father Patrick Yaldrini Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut Catholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs actuelles that as I have just explained Mgr Lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop It is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel Church Cardinal Rosalio Lara President of the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of Canon Law commented on the consecrations in the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica It would be hard to imagine a more authoritative opinion The Cardinal wrote The act of consecrating a bishop without a papal mandate is not in itself a schismatic act In fact the Code that deals with offenses is divided into two sections One deals with offenses against religion and the unity of the Church and these are apostasy schism and heresy Consecrating a bishop with a pontifical mandate is on the contrary an offense against the exercise of a specific ministry For example in the case of the consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh Thuc in 1976 and 1983 although the Archbishop was excommunicated he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because there was no intention of a breach with the Church It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church He is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic The Archbishop considers correctly that the the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society Canon Law provides for just such a situation and even if one believes that the future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means as Canon Law states clearly that he has not incurred excommunication Furthermore while the Vatican allows such prelates as Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot expect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the Church and the salvation of souls Dr Eric M de Saventhem President of the International Una Voce Association is one of the best informed laymen in the Church and he knows the Archbishop intimately Dr de Saventhem like myself has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr Lefebvre and the Holy See during the Archbishop s lifetime A quotation from a statement by Dr de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February 1989 Remnant merits careful study In retrospect the road leading to the consecrations of 30 June appears more paved with grave Roman and unfortunately also papal omissions than with Lefebvrist obstinancies And from the eyes of an informed public this cannot be hidden by attempting to present the Archbishop s act of grave disobedience as an offense against the Faith It is said today that Mgr Lefebvre has an erroneous concept of Tradition If this were so Cardinal Ratzinger could not on behalf of the Pope have addressed to the Archbishop the following words in his letter of 28 July 1987 Your ardent desire to safeguard Tradition by procuring for it the means to live and prosper testifies to your attachment to the Faith of all time the Holy Father understands your concern and shares it', 'From Joseph H Buehler Subject Re SSPX schism Organization none Lines 240 Larry L Overacker writes responding to Simon I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the net My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in schism or legitimately excommunicated But that s really beside the point What does the Roman Catholic church say Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication as provided for in canon law Here s some of the theology involved for the interested There is confusion over this issue of the SSPX s schism often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between true obedience false obedience disobedience schism Take the various classifications of obedience first There are 2 important elements involved here for my purposes 1 a command 2 the response made to the command As far as the command goes commands can be LEGITIMATE such as the Pope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays Or they can be ILLEGITIMATE such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god Dagon when every other full moon comes around As far as the response to a command goes it can be to REFUSE to do what is commanded or to COMPLY Making a table there are thus 4 possibilites command response name LEGITIMATE COMPLY true obedience ILLEGITIMATE REFUSE true obedience LEGITIMATE REFUSE disobedience ILLEGITIMATE COMPLY false obedience So now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from Obedience is not solely a matter of compliance refusal The nature of the commands must also be taken into account it is not enough to consider someone s compliance or refusal and then say whether they are obedient or disobedient You also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad In my example if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god Dagon and they all refuse they aren t being disobedient at all As far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes they are certainly refusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires But that alone is insufficient to allow one to label them disobedient You also have to consider the nature of the Papal desires And there s the rub SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been commanding certain very bad things for the Church The Popes have of course disagreed So where are we Are we in another Arian heresy complete with weak Popes Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers Well the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what and what the traditional teaching of the Church is The problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of what is really going on and what the issues are The religion of American Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth You will never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press in this country On the other hand one Italian Catholic magazine I get 30 Days has had interviews with the Superior General of the Society of Saint Pius X Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope There is some soundness in this because the Papacy is infallible so eventually some Pope will straighten all this out But on the other hand there is also unsoundness in this in that in the short term the Popes may indeed be wrong and such Catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where they re wrong In fact if the situation is grave enough they sin in obeying him At the very least they re wasting a great opportunity because they are failing to love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this badly Schism let s move on to schism What is it Schism is a superset of disobedience refusal to obey a legitimate command All schismatics are disobedient But it s a superset so it doesn t work the other way around not all disobeyers are schismatics The mere fact that the SSPX priests don t comply with the Holy Father s desires doesn t make them schismatics So what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a schism Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics You must add this the rejection of the right to command Look in any decent reference on Catholic theology and that s what you ll find the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to command Here s what the Catholic Encyclopedia says for example not every disobedience is a schism in order to possess this character it must include besides the trangression of the commands of superiors denial of their Divine right to command from the CE article Schism Is the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic The answer is a clear no they say that the Pope is their boss They pray for him every day And that s all that matters as far as schism goes What all this boils down to is this if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objections their position is a legitimate one as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and schism goes They are resisting certain Papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of the Papacy and the best interests of the Church In fact someone who finds himself in this situation has a duty to resist Now what is the stance of Rome on all this Well if you read the Holy Father s motu proprio Ecclesia Dei you can find out It s the definitive document on the subject A motu proprio is a specifically Papal act It s not the product of a Roman congregation a letter that the Pope has possibly never even read It s from the Pope himself His boss is God there s no one else to complain to In this document the Holy Father says among other things 1 The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre constituted a schismatic act 2 Archbishop Lefebvre s problem was a misunderstanding of the nature of Tradtion Both are confusing I fail to see the logic of the Pope s points As far as the episcopal consecrations go I read an interesting article in a translation of the Italian magazine Si Si No No It all gets back to the question of jurisdiction If episcopal consecrations imply rejection of the Pope s jurisdiction then they would truly constitute a schismatic act justifying excommunication under the current code of canon law But my problem with this is this according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction It only confers the power of Order the ability to confect the Sacraments Jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it such as the Pope The Society bishops knowing the traditional theology quite well take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop The Si Si No No article was interesting in that it posited that the reason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel post Vatican II idea of Holy Orders According to this idea episcopal consecration does confer jurisdiction I lent the article to a friend unfortunately so can t tell you more I believe they quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea The Pope s thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me There s no way there is a schism according to traditional Catholic theology So why does the Pope think this As far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes here s the passage in question The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete and contradictory notion of Tradtion Incomplete because it does not take sufficiently into the account the living character of Tradition which as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the help of the Holy Spirit There is a growth in insight into the realities and words that are being passed on This comes about in various ways It comes through the contemplation and study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which they experience And it comes from the preaching of those who have received along with their right of succession in the espiscopate the sure charism of truth But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops It is impossible to remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond with him to whom in the person of the Apostle Peter Christ himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church Papal motu proprio Ecclesia Dei 2 July 1988 It seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can be simplified to the following Vatican Council II has happened I am the Pope The argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that Archbishop Lefebvre must be wrong because he disagrees with them This is weak to say the least It would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed Archbishop Lefebvre s concerns in detail What is John Paul II s stand on the social Kingship of Christ as taught by Gregory XVI Pius IX Leo XIII Pius XI and Pius XII for example Are we supposed to ignore what all these Popes said on the subject I don t know what the future will hold but the powers that be in the SSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey justified disobedience or even obeying God rather than man Calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in Wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean Similarly schism indicates a formal break in the church If the Pope says that a schism exists it seems to me that by definition it exists It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break that there is no good reason for the break to exist and that it will shortly be healed But how can one deny that it does in fact exist It seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing you are trying to reform the power of the papacy What good will it do you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future but in the process you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church discipline It s one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his powers and excommunicated someone wrongly It s something else to say that his excommunication did not take effect and the schism is all in his imagination That means that acts of church discipline are not legal tools but acts whose validity is open to debate Generally it has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope While they have often objected to church sanctions generally they have admitted that the sanctions exist You are now opening the door to people simply ignoring papal decisions claiming to be truly obeying by disobeying and to be in communion while excommunicated This would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command that you say defines schism clh', 'From Larry L Overacker Subject Re SSPX schism Organization Shell Oil Lines 99 In article Joseph H Buehler writes Descriptions of true and false obedience Obedience is not solely a matter of compliance refusal The nature of the commands must also be taken into account it is not enough to consider someone s compliance or refusal and then say whether they are obedient or disobedient You also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad You ask where we are I would echo that question I m not trying to be contentious But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction and authority what authority do you rely upon for your decisions What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time This is especially true since Councils of Bishops have basically stood by the Pope It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition and also over authority and discipline My question to the supporters of SSPX is this Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms could change and be conformed to those of the Pope assuming that the Pope s position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX don t jointly make such choice If not this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority If I adopt the view that I m NOT wrong I CAN T be wrong and there s NO WAY I ll change my mind YOU must change yours that I ve either left the Catholic Church or it has left me The Orthodox Church does not recognize papal authority jurisdiction viewing authority as present in each bishop and in Ecumenical Councils We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines regarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of the Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church Without going into the merits of the Great Schism at least the Orthodox agree that a split occurred and don t paly what appear to be semantic games like He s the Pope but we don t recognize that what he does is effective Words aside it appears to be a de facto split So where are we Are we in another Arian heresy complete with weak Popes Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers Well the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what and what the traditional teaching of the Church is We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the real traditional teaching of the Church is If this were a simple matter East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope There is some soundness in this because the Papacy is infallible so eventually some Pope will straighten all this out I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term I may be wrong here I m not Roman Catholic What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement regarding the SSPX situation Would it be honored If not how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility Again I m not trying to be contentions I m trying to understand Since I m Orthodox I ve got no real vested interest in the outcome one way or the other Schism is a superset of disobedience refusal to obey a legitimate command All schismatics are disobedient But it s a superset so it doesn t work the other way around not all disobeyers are schismatics The mere fact that the SSPX priests don t comply with the Holy Father s desires doesn t make them schismatics It does if the command was legitimate SSPX does not view the Pope s commands as legitimate Why This is a VERY slippery slope But my problem with this is this according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction It only confers the power of Order the ability to confect the Sacraments True enough Jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it such as the Pope The Society bishops knowing the traditional theology quite well take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop One could argue that they are establishing a non geographic jurisdiction I don t know if that s even a concept or problem in Catholic circles Larry Overacker Lawrence

Richard C Paddock Times staff writer SAN FRANCISCO Police on Thursday served search warrants on the Anti Defamation League here and in Los Angeles seizing evidence of a nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than 950 political groups newspapers and labor unions and as many as 12 000 people Describing the spy operation in great detail San Francisco authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how operatives of the Anti Defamation League searched through trash and infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab American right wing and what they called pinko organizations Representatives of the Anti Defamation League a well known organization in the U S Jewish community dedicated to fighting anti Semitism declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking any laws Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to gather political intelligence in at least seven cities including Los Angeles and San Francisco Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political spectrum including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan the White Aryan Resistance Operation Rescue Greenpeace the National Assn for the Advancement of Colored People the United Farm Workers and the Jewish Defense League Also on the list were Mills College the board of directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper People who were subjects of the spy operation included former Republican Rep Pete McCloskey jailed political extremist Lyndon H LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft who is based in South Africa Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement agencies They also alleged that data on some individuals and organizations was sold separately to the South African government In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from police the Anti Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West Coast spy Roy Bullock according to the affidavit filed to justify the search warrant The Anti Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than 25 years by funneling 550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I Hochman who then paid Bullock according to the documents released in San Francisco Hochman a former president of the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state s leading tax attorneys will be out of the city until late next week and could not be reached for comment his office said Until 1990 Hochman a former U S prosecutor also was a member of a panel appointed by then Sen Pete Wilson to secretly make initial recommendations on new federal judges in California Hochman is a former regional president of the Anti Defamation League The league which initially cooperated with police has denied repeatedly that its intelligence gathering operation broke any laws League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an employee and have said they simply traded information with police departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday s searches San Francisco police alleged that ADL employees were apparently less than truthful in providing information during an earlier search conducted without a warrant David Lehrer executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office said the organization has not violated the law There is nothing nefarious about how we operate or what we have done he said Our record speaks for itself The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret fund used to pay for fact finding operations Lehrer according to the documents signed checks from the account under the name L Patterson An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending them directly to the Anti Defamation League Bullock 58 who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for nearly 40 years defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with San Francisco police He said that he gathered names from many sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as Skins and Pinkos but that did not necessarily mean that they were under surveillance I might never see or call up on 99 of them again Bullock said And it doesn t mean anything that they re in the files It s not a threat to anyone s civil rights that a name appears in my files under say Pinko In recent years Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police Officer Tom Gerard who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he was questioned by the FBI in the case A former CIA employee Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses vehicle registration physical characteristics and drivers license photographs Using files gathered for the Anti Defamation League Gerard and Bullock also provided information to the South African government receiving 16 000 over four years the documents show The file on Times staff writer Kraft which was apparently sold to the South African government provides some insight into the hit and miss nature of the spy operation The file notes that Kraft s articles appear frequently in The Times and are well researched and written but little else about the file is accurate The brief entry confuses The Times Kraft with another Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong Kraft s physical description photograph and other personal information Nevertheless the documents provide illuminating details of how Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations from skinheads to left wing radicals searching regularly through the trash of target groups Using Anti Defamation League funds he also ran his own paid informants under code names such as Scott and Scumbag He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies including the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms It was Bullock s work as a paid informant for the FBI while spying on behalf of the Anti Defamation League and the South African government that proved his undoing The FBI learned that he was an agent of a foreign government and began investigating leading to the probe of the Anti Defamation League s intelligence network The Anti Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather information in Los Angeles San Francisco New York Washington Chicago St Louis and Atlanta according to the affidavit and investigators Joining San Francisco police in searching league offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of San Francisco Dist Atty Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax Board

INVESTIGATION By Richard C Paddock Times staff writer SAN FRANCISCO The Anti Defamation League defended its record as a civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential police information on citizens and groups But San Francisco Dist Atty Arlo Smith said that Anti Defamation League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many felony counts of receiving confidential files eavesdropping tax violations and conspiracy Police have accused the Anti Defamation League of not being truthful about its spying operations which collected information on more than 12 000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political spectrum Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept files on political figures Even so Smith suggested that if the Anti Defamation League shut down its spy operation prosecutors would take that into account when deciding what charges to file In a statement released in Washington National Director Abraham H Foxman described the ADL as a Jewish defense agency which has fought to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80 years Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing information to police journalists academics government officials and the public It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain information illegally he said Like other journalists in order to protect the confidentiality and physical safety of its sources ADL will not comment on the nature or identity of any source of information Foxman said The Anti Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its longtime employees Roy Bullock was anything more than a private individual who is alleged to be an ADL informant Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I Hochman Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be distanced from ADL Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment Despite the Anti Defamation League s assertion that it will cooperate with authorities San Francisco police said the group did not turn over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group s offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall A second round of searches Thursday this time with search warrants produced a vast quantity of records primarily dealing with financial transactions Smith said Further searches may be necessary and it will be at least

EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE INQUIRY Transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage by a man who infiltrated political groups By Richard C Paddock Times staff writer SAN FRANCISCO To the outside world Roy Bullock was a small time art dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District In reality he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and amassed secret files for the Anti Defamation League for nearly 40 years His code name at the prominent Jewish organization was Cal and he was so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen to head an Arab American delegation that visited Rep Nancy Pelosi D San Francisco in her Washington D C office For a time Cal tapped into the phone message system of the White Aryan Resistance to learn of hate crimes From police sources he obtained privileged personal information on at least 1 394 people And he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African government to trade his knowledge for crisp new 100 bills These are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz a former Los Angeles based operative divulged in extensive interviews with police and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation wide intelligence network operated by the Anti Defamation League Officials of the Anti Defamation League while denying any improper activity have said they will cooperate with the investigation They have refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz Transcripts of the interviews among nearly 700 pages of documents released by San Francisco prosecutors last week offer new details of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line into illegal territory At times the intelligence activities took on a cloak and dagger air with laundered payments shredded documents hotel rendezvous with foreign agents and code names like Ironsides and Flipper On one occasion Gurvitz recounts he received a tip that a pro Palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa Israel Although the Anti Defamation League publicly denies any ties to Israel Gurvitz phoned an Israeli consular official to warn him Shortly afterward another official called Gurvitz back and debriefed him The court papers also added to the mystery of Tom Gerard a former CIA agent and San Francisco police officer accused of providing confidential material from police files to the Anti Defamation League Gerard fled to the Philippines last fall after he was interviewed by the FBI but left behind a briefcase in his police locker Its contents included passports driver s licenses and identification cards in 10 different names identification cards in his own name for four American embassies in Central America and a collection of blank birth certificates Army discharge papers and official stationery from various agencies Also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads a black hood apparently for use in interrogations and photos of blindfolded and chained men Investigators suspect that Gerard and other police sources gave the ADL confidential driver s license or vehicle registration information on a vast number of people including as many as 4 500 members of one target group the Arab American Anti Discrimination Committee Each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would constitute a felony San Francisco Police Inspector Ron Roth noted in an affidavit for a search warrant The Anti Defamation League a self described Jewish defense and civil rights organization acknowledges it has long collected information on groups that are anti Semitic extremist or racist The ADL s fact finding division headed by Irwinn Suall in New York enjoys a reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with police agencies and journalists However evidence seized from Bullock s computer shows he kept files on at least 950 groups of all political stripes including the American Civil Liberties Union Earth Island Institute the United Farm Workers Jews for Jesus Mother Jones magazine the Center for Investigative Reporting the Bo Gritz for President Committee the Asian Law Caucus and the AIDS activist group ACT UP The computer files also included information on several members of Congress including Pelosi House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ron Dellums D Berkeley and former Republican Rep Pete McCloskey from the Bay Area In their statements Bullock and Gurvitz said the Anti Defamation League has collected information on political activists in the Los Angeles area for more than 30 years They said they worked closely with three Los Angeles County sheriff s deputies who specialized in intelligence work a Los Angeles Police Department anti terrorism expert and a San Diego County Sheriff s Department intelligence officer A spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff s Department said he knew nothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL The Los Angeles Police Department which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation and the San Diego Sheriff s Department declined comment Bullock 58 is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy drama Although he is not Jewish he began working undercover as a volunteer for the ADL and the FBI in Indiana in 1954 after reading a book about a man who infiltrated the Communist Party Bullock moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by the ADL as an intelligence operative he told authorities In the mid 1970s he moved to San Francisco and continued his spy operations up and down the West Coast To keep his identity secret his salary has always been funneled through Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I Hochman who has never missed a payment in more than 32 years Bullock said I was an investigator for the ADL I investigated any and all anti democratic movements Bullock said Officially I m only a contract worker with Bruce Hochman That way the league would not be officially connected with me Bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communists to Arab American to gay radicals to skinheads usually using his own name but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink I m one of a kind he told police In recent years however his ADL affiliation has increasingly become known and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a shotgun who threatened to kill him In the mid 1980s he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at a synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps and matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by police In part because of this investigation he became close friends with Gerard who at the time was working in the San Francisco police intelligence division Bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups An FBI report noted how he investigated one Palestinian group Bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash and would share the reports with Gerard Bullock also gave the trash to Gerard for Gerard to examine Gerard would later return the trash to Bullock From a wide range of sources Bullock compiled files on 9 876 individuals and more than 950 political groups Gerard whose files contained many identical entries kept files on 7 011 people In 1987 Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of information to the South African government Bullock tells of meetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotels and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new 100 bills Bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled only from public sources Once he rewrote an innocuous item published by San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen about South African Bishop Desmond Tutu and the wife of prominent attorney Melvin Belli and submitted it as his own work Bullock said it was Gerard who sold official police intelligence Bullock said he split about 16 000 from the South African government evenly with Gerard telling him at one point I may be gay but I m a straight arrow In his interviews with the police and FBI Bullock talked freely about engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to violate the law For example Bullock admitted to receiving driver s license records and criminal histories from Gerard on about 50 people a fraction of the confidential police data found in his computer And he said Gerard gave him complete San Francisco Police Department intelligence files on various Nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under department policy Bullock said he also received a confidential FBI report on the Nation of Islam that he later shredded at the Anti Defamation League s San Francisco office Bullock seemed proud of his Operation Eavesdrop in which he used a paid informant code named Scumbag to help tap into a White Aryan Resistance phone message network listening to the messages left by members of the right wing group For a short time it was wonderful he told police In Los Angeles ADL operative Gurvitz was hired about four years ago as a fact finder to keep intelligence files and occasionally go undercover to the meetings of target groups Among other things he told San Francisco authorities the Los Angeles ADL office kept a record of any Arab American who had anti Israel leanings or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such sentiment Gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he attempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on a rival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies Gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival and threatened to expose him as a Jewish spy to a right wing hate group Gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the FBI in the probe providing considerable information about the ADL operation Unlike Bullock he has been assured he is not a subject of the investigation Gurvitz declined through his father in

defendants in the suit filed in San Francisco County Superior Court The 19 accuse the ADL of B nai B rith a group dedicated to fighting anti Semitism and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on them including data from state and federal agencies The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others including the governments of Israel and South Africa in what it alleges was a a massive spying operation The action is a class action suit It was filed on behalf of about 12 000 anti apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the plaintiffs believe the ADL Bullock and Gerard gathered information Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately available for comment on Wednesday The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that Gerard a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit passed confidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL Bullock and Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL s offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources It seeks exemplary damages of at least 2 500 per person as well as other unspecified damages Lawyer Pete McCloskey a former Congresmen who is representing the plaintiffs said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab Americans and Jews and his wife Helen who also had information gathered about her One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens a research scientist at the University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence Minister Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on him in the 1980s presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of Palestinians and his position on the Israeli occupied territories According to court documents released last week Bullock and Gerard both kept information on thousands of California political activists In the documents a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and Bullock received confidential information from the authorities No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case The ADL Bullock and Gerard have all denied

of Israel sued the Anti Defamation League on Wednesday saying it invaded their privacy by illegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network The ADL a national group dedicated to fighting anti Semitism intended to use the data to discredit them because of their political views according to the class action lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court None of us has been guilty of racism or Nazism or anti Semitism or hate crimes or any of the other isms that the ADL claims to protect against None of us is violent or criminal in any way said Carol El Shaieb an education consultant who develops programs on Arab culture The 19 plaintiffs include Yigal Arens son of former Israel Defense Minister Moshe Arens The younger Arens a research scientist at the University of Southern California said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably because he has criticized Israel s treatment of Palestinians The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American or speaks politically against Israel is at least a closet anti Semite Arens said The ADL has denied any wrongdoing but couldn t comment on the lawsuit because it hasn t reviewed it said a spokesman at the ADL s New York headquarters The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that the ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups including white supremacist and anti Semitic organizations Arab Americans Greenpeace the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Francisco public television station KQED Some information allegedly came from confidential police and government records according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit No charges have been filed in the criminal investigation The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California s privacy law which forbids the intentional disclosure of personal information not otherwise public from state or federal records The

The class action suit filed in San Francisco Superior Court charges the ADL and its leadership conspired with a local police official to obtain information on outspoken opponents of Israeli policies towards the Occupied Territories and South Africa s apartheid policy The ADL refused to comment on the suit The suit also took aim at two top local ADL officials and retired San Francicso police officer Tom Gerard claiming they violated privacy guarantees in the state constitution and violated state confidentiality laws According to the suit Gerard helped the ADL obtain access to confidential files in law enforcement and government computers Information from these files were passed to the foreign governments the suit charges The whole concept of an organized collection of information based on political viewpoints and using government agencies as a source of information is absolutely repugnant said former Rep Pete McCloskey who is representing the plaintiffs The ADL s information gathering network was revealed publicly last week when the San Francisco District Attorney s Office released documents indicating the group had spied on 12 000 people and 500 political and ethnic groups for more than 30 years My understanding is that they the ADL consider all activity that is in some sense opposed to Israel or Israeli action to be part of their responsbility to investigate said Arens a research scientist at the University of Southern California The ADL believes that anyone who is Arab American or speaks politically against Israel is at least a closet anti Semite The FBI and the District Attorney s Office have been investigating the operation for four months The 19 plaintiffs in the case include Arens the son of former Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens In a press release the plaintiffs said the alleged spying had damaged them psychologically and economically and accused the ADL of trying to interfere with their freedom of speech']"

Lines 416 I have come across what I consider to be an excellent tract It is a bit lengthy for a posting but I thought I d share it with all of you anyway Feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might benefit from what it says May God richly bless those who read it D O E S G O D L O V E Y O U Q What kind of question is that Anyone who can read sees signs tracts books and bumper stickers that say God Loves You Isn t that true A It is true that God offers His love to the whole world as we read in one of the most quoted verses in the Bible For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life John 3 16 However God s love is qualified The Bible says The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness Proverbs 15 9 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly shall perish Psalm 1 6 Q But I am not wicked I am a decent moral person Surely the good I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done How can these verses apply to me A By God s standard of righteousness even the most moral person is looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to Hell The Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven On the contrary we are all sinners and we are all guilty before God As it is written There is none righteous no not one There is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after God Romans 3 10 11 The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it Jeremiah 17 9 Q If I am such a wicked person in God s sight what will God do to me A The Bible teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell For a fire is kindled in mine anger and shall burn unto the lowest hell and shall consume the earth with her increase and set on fire the foundations of the mountains I will heap mischiefs upon them I will spend mine arrows upon them They shall be burnt with hunger and devoured with burning heat and with bitter destruction I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them with the poison of serpents of the dust Deuteronomy 32 22 24 Q Oh come on now Hell is not real is it Surely things are not that bad A Indeed Hell is very real and things are that bad for the individ ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior The Bible makes many references to Hell indicating that it is both eternal and consists of perpetual suffering And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire Revelation 20 15 So shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just And shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth Matthew 13 49 50 when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power 2 Thessalonians 1 7 9 Q That is terrible Why would God create a Hell A Hell is terrible and it exists because God created man to be accountable to God for his actions God s perfect justice demands payment for sin For the wages of sin is death Romans 6 23 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad 2 Corinthians 5 10 But I say unto you That every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment Matthew 12 36 Q Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell A Indeed it does that is unless we can find someone to be our substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal damnation for our sins That someone is God Himself who came to earth as Jesus Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him All we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all Isaiah 53 6 But he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed Isaiah 53 5 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures And that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures 1 Corinthians 15 3 4 For he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him 2 Corinthians 5 21 Q Are you saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute Who was already punished for my sins then I will not have to worry about Hell anymore A Yes this is so If I have believed in Christ as my Savior then it is as if I have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life but the wrath of God abideth on him John 3 36 Q But what does it mean to believe on Him If I agree with all that the Bible says about Christ as Savior then am I saved from going to Hell A Believing on Christ means a whole lot more than agreeing in our minds with the truths of the Bible It means that we hang our whole lives on Him It means that we entrust every part of our lives to the truths of the Bible It means that we turn away from our sins and serve Christ as our Lord No man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other Ye cannot serve God and mammon Matthew 6 24 Repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord Acts 3 19 Q Are you saying that there is no other way to escape Hell except through Jesus What about all the other religions Will their followers also go to Hell A Yes indeed They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account able for our sins God demands that we pay for our sins Other religions cannot provide a substitute to bear the sins of their followers Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and save us Neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved Acts 4 12 Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the Father but by me John 14 6 If we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness 1 John 1 9 Q Now I am desperate I do not want to go to Hell What can I do A You must remember that God is the only one who can help you You must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God As you see your hopeless condition as a sinner cry out to God to save you And the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner Luke 18 13 Sirs what must I do to be saved And they said Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved Acts 16 30 31 Q But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him A Wonderfully God not only saves us through the Lord Jesus but He also gives us the faith to believe on Him You can pray to God that He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior For by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God Ephesians 2 8 God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith So if you really mean business with God about your salvation you should use every opportunity to hear and study the Bible which is the only Word of God In this brochure all verses from the Bible are within indented paragraphs Give heed to them with all your heart So then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Romans 10 17 Q But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God A Yes God wants us to come to Him in total humility acknowledging our sinfulness and our helplessness trusting totally in Him The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart O God thou wilt not despise Psalm 51 17 Because we are sinners we love our sins Therefore we must begin to pray to God for an intense hatred of our sins And if we sincerely desire salvation we will also begin to turn from our sins as God strengthens us We know that our sins are sending us to Hell Unto you first God having raised up his Son Jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities Acts 3 26 Q Doesn t the Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be baptized Will these save me A If possible we should do these things but they will not save us No work of any kind can secure our salvation Salvation is God s sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas ure Salvation is Not of works lest any man should boast Ephesians 2 9 Q What else will happen at the end of the world A Those who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ forever more For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord 1 Thessalonians 4 16 17 Q What will happen to the earth at that time A God will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers forever more But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up Nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness 2 Peter 3 10 13 Q Does the Bible give us any idea of when the end of the earth will come A Yes The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to save And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come Matthew 24 14 Q Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be A Yes God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved it will not come as a thief for the believers There is much evidence in the Bible that the end of the world and the return of Christ may be very very close All the time clues in the Bible point to this For when they shall say Peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape 1 Thessalonians 5 3 Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets Amos 3 7 Q But that means Judgment Day is almost here A Yes it does God warned ancient Nineveh that He was going to destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning And Jonah began to enter into the city a day s journey and he cried and said Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown Jonah 3 4 Q What did the people of Nineveh do A From the king on down they humbled themselves before God repented of their sins and cried to God for mercy But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto God yea let them turn every one from his evil way and from the violence that is in their hands Who can tell if God will turn and repent and turn away from his fierce anger that we perish not Jonah 3 8 9 Q Did God hear their prayers A Yes God saved a great many people of Nineveh Q Can I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg ment A Yes There is still time to become saved even though that time has become very short How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him Hebrews 2 3 In God is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God Trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him God is a refuge for us Psalm 62 7 8 A R E Y O U

have ever come across and agree with him that there is just too much data to ignore While none of us is guaranteed one more second of life and while we therefore should take these matters very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return it would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our eternal destiny until we feel that our death is imminent is even more

facts BM while hoping that Turkey will stay out Stop and think for a moment BM will you Armenia doesn t need anyone to drag her into the conflict it BM is a part of it henrik Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged henrik training AZERIS militarily to fight against KARABAKHI Armenians So Should I at this point break into caps and start talking about DEFENSE etc I don t know how fully engaged Turkey is was though henrik The KARABAKHI ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000 henrik years CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN are the henrik ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT They are defending henrik themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION BM Huh You didn t expect Azeri s to be friendly to forces fighting with them BM within their borders henrik Well history is SAD Remember those are relocated Azeris into henrik the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime So I hear This justifies bloodshed N years after the fact henrik At last I hope that the U S insists that Turkey stay out of the henrik KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER henrik OCCUR again BM You re not playing with a full deck are you Where would Turkey invade henrik It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped henrik into Armenia if SHE could Why would Turkey do that Do you not realize that this is a local clash that Turkey never wished to see happen Turkey has other plans for region like economic revival co operation etc Good stuff in other words I d be happy to bicker with Armenians over trade barriers and such on USENET rather than who killed whom in what way which I detest doing and wouldn t do BM Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s c g in the header BM in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun henrik Absolutely NOT I am merely trying to emphasize that in many henrik cases HISTORY repeats itself Even if one buys into your implicit premise the sane thing to do would be to try not to provoke Turkey as was done in 74 If there d been a democratic government instead of a bunch of idiots in Athens at the time everybody would have stayed home with their families I have no wish to go into the Cyprus quarrel but I suspect what I ve said is not only accurate but also palatable to all parties involved BM Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene what she wishes BM she had however is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring BM the parties to the negotiating table That s hard to do when Armenians BM are attacking Azeri towns henrik So let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying Turkey henrik wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT NOT So what do you think we want War death and destruction henrik I will believe it when I see it No if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it henrik Now as far as attacking what do you do when you see a GUN pointing henrik to your HEAD Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef fat chance This kind of childish rhetoric doesn t help anthing henrik Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU All the henrik BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS

hatred alive right BM Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the BM futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that BM leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that s BM going to cause incessant skirmishes henrik Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic They are henrik NOT asking much They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY henrik from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN Well they obviously aren t getting anywhere with their current methods of asking not very peaceful I d say BM Think of 10 or 20 years down the line both of the newly independent BM countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe BM the other out These people will be neighbors would it not be better BM to keep the bad blood between them minimal henrik Don t get me WRONG I also want PEACEFUL solution to the henrik conflict But until Azeris realize that the Armenians in henrik KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion I don t know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans Peace isn t what s happening right now furthermore what s happening right now isn t condusive to peace You can spend days and nights raving about how right the Armenian position is and I m sure there ll be others who d be happy to talk to you by arguing the other side If entrenched positions lead to war and if people want peace than they should sit down and talk about a compromise Armenia isn t strong enough to exercise the we think we re right and we have the bombs so we ll do whatever we want so there style of foreign relations Yes you can type Stalin in caps and give one sided atrocity stories etc but for peace you need to be willing to talk to the other side You personally can choose not to do that of course this being just USENET The people in power shouldn t be so childish BM If you belong to the Armenian diaspora keep in mind that what strikes BM your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of BM their blood and future henrik Again you are taking different TURNS Armenia HAS no intension henrik to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan The Armenians in KARABAKH henrik are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET Azeri s would disagree with you on this and the maps I ve seen support what they d be saying It doesn t seem likely that a solution will be reached in this manner BM It s easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize BM craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled The Armenians BM in Armenia and N K will be there with the same

pump Distribution na Organization Tektronix Colorado Data Systems Englewood CO Lines 58 In article Jeff Burney writes If we are only talking about 4 stroke I think I can understand exhaust pulse affect in a 2 stroke the intake valve is closed on the exhaust stroke and the gas is pushed out by the cyclinder I guess there is some gas compression that may affect the amount pushed out but the limiting factor seems to be the header pipe and not the canister Meaning would gases so far down the line the canister really have an effect on the exhaust stroke Do the gases really compress that much For discussion purposes I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses in the exhaust pipe and try to paint a useful mental picture 1 Unless an engine is supercharged the pressure available to force air into the intake tract is _atmospheric_ At the time the intake valve is opened the pressure differential available to move air is only the difference between the combustion chamber pressure left over after the exhaust stroke and atmospheric As the piston decends on the intake stroke combustion chamber pressure is decreased allowing atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract At no time does the pressure ever become negative or even approach a good vacuum 2 At the time of the exhaust valve closing the pressure in the combustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up to the first major flow restriction the muffler Note that the volume of gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume that must flow through the intake because of the temperature difference and the products of combustion 3 In the last 6 8 years the Japanese manufacturers have started paying attention to exhaust and intake tuning in pursuit of almighty horsepower At this point in time on high performance bikes substitution of an aftermarket free flow air filter will have almost zero affect on performance because the stock intake system flows very well anyway Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make very little difference unless in general the new exhaust system is _much_ louder than the stocker 4 On older bikes exhaust back pressure was the dominating factor If free flowing air filters were substituted very little difference was noted unless a free flowing exhaust system was installed as well 5 In general an engine can be visualized as an air pump At any given RPM anything that will cause the engine to pump more air be it on the intake or exhaust side will cause it to produce more horsepower Pumping more

A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView Since he isn t in the position to post this himself he asked me to post it for him but to leave his name out So here it comes CView has quite a number of bugs The one you mention is perhaps the most annoying but not the most dangerous As far as I can determine it has to do with the temp files that CView creates CView gives the user no control over where it places its temp files it just places them in its current directory The problem you mention occurs as far as I can tell when it runs out of disk space for its temp files It seems as if CView doesn t check properly for this situation As Cview decodes a jpeg it seems to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour information Then for 8 bit displays it does the dithering again writing another file with the 8 bit colour information While it is writing this second file it also writes the data to your colour card Then when it does the last chunk of 8 bit data it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to your screen again It does this last recopy operation for its fit to screen feature even when this feature is not enabled The result of this process is the following 1 If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file all you ever see is as much data as it has room for and the last bit of data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes reads aren t performed 2 If it has enough room for the 24 bit data but runs out of room for the 8 bit data you see almost all of the picture as it does the dithering and writes to the screen card However then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data from the 8 bit file to screen for whatever reason it does this one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which there was room on the disk This is just a guess but probably fairly accurate At least the general idea is on track I think although I have probably made errors in details about file I O etc The way around this is of course to clear up sufficient disk space The temp files for large JPEG s 1200x900 and bigger can be very large 3 Meg 1 Meg On some of the largest I have needed in excess of 6 Meg free disk space CView has a much more serious bug if you are trying to display a file from a floppy and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the floppy then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory and FAT table I can t remember for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted floppy thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious possibly unrevcoverable way SO BE CAREFUL It is incredibly poor programming for a program to do this On the other hand when choosing files in the Open Files menu CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hi lighter square Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory info And really how much effort does it take to sort a directory listing With much thanks to the originator of this article Rene Walter Will I drown in tears of sorrow Is there hope for tomorrow Will this world ever get better Can t we all

Organization BNR Inc Lines 38 In article Fred Rice writes There has been some discussion on the pros and cons about sex outside of marriage Where is the evidence for my opinions At the moment there are just generalities I can cite For example I read that in the 20th century the percentage of youth and people in general who suffer from depression has been steadily climbing in Western societies probably what I was reading referred particularly to the USA Similarly one can detect a trend towards greater occurrence of sex outside of marriage in this century in Western societies particularly with the sexual revolution of the 60 s but even before that I think otherwise the sexual revolution of the 60 s would not have been possible particularly with the gradual weakening of Christianity and consequently Christian moral teachings against sex outside of marriage I propose that these two trends greater level of general depression in society and other psychological problems and greater sexual promiscuity are linked with the latter being a prime cause of the former I cannot provide any evidence beyond this at this stage but the whole thesis seems very reasonable to me and I request that people ponder upon it Fred Rice a Muslim giving his point of view I think this is a big leap sex depression One example is myself where no sex depression But seriously 1 promiscuity is on a decline depression is not and 2 it might be more reasonable to say depression promiscuity I think depression is more likely to come from emotional problems relationships family job friends and promiscuity is used as an escape Since I see marriage as a civil and religious bond rather than an emotional bond I don t see a problem with sex before not outside of marriage so long as you have the

marriage Organization Monash University Melb Australia Lines 115 In Lucio de Re writes Fred Rice writes My point of view is that the argument all sexism is bad just simply does not hold Let me give you an example How about permitting a woman to temporarily leave her job due to pregnancy should that be allowed It happens to be sexist as it gives a particular right only to women Nevertheless despite the fact that it is sexist I completely support such a law because I think it is just Fred you re exasperating Sexism like racialism is a form of discrimination using obvious physical or cultural differences to deny one portion of the population the same rights as another In this context your example above holds no water whatsoever there s no discrimination in denying men maternity leave in fact I m quite convinced that were anyone to experiment with male pregnancy it would be possible for such a future father to take leave on medical grounds Okay I argued this thoroughly about 3 4 weeks ago Men and women are different physically physiologically and psychologically Much recent evidence for this statement is present in the book Brainsex by Anne Moir and David Jessel I recommend you find a copy and read it Their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic and is well referenced Now if women and men are different in some ways the law can only adequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are different by also taking into account the ways in which men and women are different Maternity leave is an example of this it takes into account that women get pregnant It does not give women the same rules it would give to men because to treat women like it treats men in this instance would be unjust This is just simply an obvious example of where men and women are intrinsically different Now people make the _naive_ argument that sexism oppression However maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT Men do not have the same access to leave that women do not to the same extent or degree and therefore IT IS SEXIST No matter however much a man _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave HE NEVER CAN And therefore the law IS SEXIST No man can have access to maternity leave NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT I hope this is clear Maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just because the sexism here just reflects the sexism of nature in making men and women different There are many other differences between men and women which are far more subtle than pregnancy and to find out more of these I recommend you have a look at the book Brainsex Your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious If men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically become women To have a womb and the other factors required for pregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is so your argument when it is examined is seen to be fallacious You are saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that women can have if they also become women which actually just supports my statement that maternity leave is sexist The discrimination comes in when a woman is denied opportunities because of her legally determined sexual inferiorities As I understand most religious sexual discrimination and I doubt that Islam is exceptional the female is not allowed into the priestly caste and in general is subjugated so that she has no aspirations to rights which as an equal human she ought to be entitled to There is no official priesthood in Islam much of this function is taken by Islamic scholars There are female Islamic scholars and female Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam An example from early Islamic history is the Prophet s widow Aisha who was recognized in her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar No matter how sweetly you coat it part of the role of religions seems historically to have served the function of oppressing the female whether by forcing her to procreate to the extent where there is no opportunity for self improvement or by denying her access to the same facilities the males are offered You have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions and I dispute it I could go on and on about women in Islam etc but I recently reposted something here under the heading Islam and Women if it is still at your news site I suggest you read it It is reposted from soc religion islam so if it has disappeared from alt atheism it still might be in soc religion islam I forgot what its original title was though I will email it to you if you like The Roman Catholic Church is the most blatant of the culprit because they actually istitutionalised a celibate clergy but the other religious are no different let a woman attempt to escape her role as child bearer and the wrath of god descends on her Your statement that other religions are no different is I think a statement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than Christianity and perhaps Judaism I ll accept your affirmation that Islam grants women the same rights as men when you can show me that any muslim woman can aspire to the same position as say Khomeini and there are no artificial religious or social obstacles on her path to achieve this Aisha who I mentioned earlier was not only an Islamic scholar but also was at one stage a military leader Show me the equivalent of Hillary Rhodam Clinton within Islam and I may consider discussing the issue with you The Prophet s first wife who died just before the Hijra the Prophet s journey from Mecca to Medina was a successful businesswoman Lucio you cannot make a strong case for your

HIV positive patients as soon as possible after seroconversion resulting from recent findings that show HIV is active in the body in large numbers much earlier than was previously believed Anthony Fauci director of the U S National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID said We must address the question of how to treat people as early as we possibly can with drugs that are safe enough to give people for years and that will get around microbial resistance He said any delay would signify questions over safety and resistance rather than a lack of funds Fauci who co authored one of the two papers published last week in Nature rejects the argument by one of his co authors Cecil Fox that the new discovery indicates that 1 billion spent on vaccine trials has been a waste of time and money because the trials were started too long after the patients were infected and were ended too quickly John Tew of the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument for early treatment of HIV infected patients AIDS activists welcomed the new information but said the scientific community has been slow to understand the significance of infection of the lymph tissue We ve known about this for five years but we re glad it is now in the public domain said Jesse Dobson of the California based Project Inform But Peter Duesberg who believes that AIDS is independent of HIV and is a result of drug abuse in the West said We are several paradoxes away from an explanation of AIDS even if these papers are right April 14 1993 Risk of

remote Three studies in the JAMA demonstrate that thousands of patients were treated by two HIV positive surgeons and dentists without becoming infected with the virus The studies were conducted by separate research teams in New Hampshire Maryland and Florida Each study started with an HIV positive doctor or dentist and tested all patients willing to participate The New Hampshire study found that none of the 1 174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an HIV positive orthopedic surgeon contracted HIV In Maryland 413 of 1 131 patients operated on by a breast surgery specialist

Alternative Medicine Advocates Divided Over New NIH Research Program AIDS Treatment News 04 02 93 No 172 P 6 Gilden Dave The new Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health has raised questions about the NIH s commitment to an effort that uses unorthodox or holistic therapeutic methods The OAM is a small division of the NIH with its budget only at 2 million dollars compared to more than 10 billion for the NIH as a whole In addition the money for available research grants is even smaller About 500 000 to 600 000 total will be available this year for 10 or 20 grants Kaiya Montaocean of the Center for Natural and Traditional Medicine in Washington D C says the OAM is afraid to become involved in AIDS They have to look successful and there is no easy answer in AIDS she said There is also a common perception that the OAM will focus on fields the NIH establishment will find non threatening such as relaxation techniques and acupuncture When the OAM called for an advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year the AIDS community was largely missing from the meeting In addition activists general lack of contact with the Office has added suspicion that the epidemic will be ignored Jon Greenberg of ACT UP New York said The OAM advisory panel is composed of practitioners without real research experience It will take them several years to accept the nature of research Nevertheless Dr Leanna Standish research director and AIDS investigator at the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in Seattle said Here is a wonderful opportunity to fund

first time scientists have indicated that natural killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack according to Anthony L Komaroff a researcher with Harvard Medical School Despite the test tube findings scientists are uncertain whether the same result occurs in the body Lusso s team also found that herpesvirus 6 produces the CD4 receptor molecule that provides access for HIV CD4 T lymphocytes express this surface receptor making them vulnerable to HIV s attack Researchers concluded that herpesvirus 6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV April 15 1993 AIDS and Priorities in

for not only ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of certain health problems but also to be committed to related policies write George Gellert and Dale F Nordenberg of the Orange County Health Care Agency Santa Ana Calif and the Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta Ga respectively Dr Berkley s editorial on why American doctors should care about the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States details several reasons for the concerted interest that all countries share in combating AIDS It should be noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence it is not the only illness doing so Diseases such as malaria and many respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations Berkley mentions the enormous social and economic impact that AIDS will have on many developing countries and the increased need for international assistance that will result Berkley also cites the lack of political aggressiveness toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade But now there is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in approach to international health and development in general and HIV AIDS in particular Vice President Al Gore proposes in his book Earth in the Balance a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable international development with programs to promote literacy improve child survival and disseminate contraceptive technology and access throughout the developing world If enacted this change in policy could drastically change the future of worldwide health AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village In Reply Journal of the American HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 45 Volume 6 Number 10 April 20 1993 Medical Association 04 07 93 Vol 269 No 13 P 1636 Berkley Seth Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as possible before the disease reaches an endemic state even at a cost of diverting less attention to some other illnesses writes Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller Foundation in New York N Y in reply to a letter by Drs Gellert and Nordenberg Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS such as malaria and respiratory and intestinal illnesses have similarly inhibited economic development in developing countries and deserve much more attention than they are getting Berkley disagrees with the contention that AIDS is receiving too much attention HIV differs from other diseases in most developing countries because it is continuing to spread For most endemic diseases the outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another year of about the same level of needless disease and death But with AIDS and its increasing spread the cost of neglect not only in disease burden but financially is much greater Interventions in the early part of a rampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are highly cost effective because each individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission Berkley says he agrees with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political leadership But he concludes that not only is assertive political leadership needed in the United States for the AIDS epidemic but even more so in developing countries with high rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic has been the rule HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 46 Volume 6 Number 10 April 20 1993 AIDS HIV Articles First HIV Vaccine Trial Begins in HIV Infected Children H H S N E W S U S DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES March 29 1993 First HIV Vaccine Therapy Trial Begins In HIV Infected Children The National Institutes of Health has opened the first trial of experimental HIV vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus HIV the virus that causes AIDS The trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90 children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide Volunteers must be HIV infected but have no symptoms of HIV disease HHS Secretary Donna E Shalala said this initial study can be seen as a hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV infected children who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS Anthony S Fauci M D director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research said the trial is the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay disease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick If these vaccines prove to be safe more sophisticated questions about their therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10 000 children in the United States have HIV By the end of the decade the World Health Organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide The study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old NIAID which funds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network anticipates conducting the trial at nine ACTG sites around the country and three sites participating in the ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows that certain vaccines can boost existing HIV specific immune responses and HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 47 Volume 6 Number 10 April 20 1993 stimulate new ones It will be several years however before researchers know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease The results from the pediatric trial known as ACTG 218 will be examined closely for other reasons as well This trial will provide the first insight into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines said Daniel Hoth M D director of NIAID s division of AIDS We need this information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent HIV infection in children In the United States most HIV infected children live in poor inner city areas and more than 80 percent are minorities mainly black or Hispanic Nearly all HIV infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during pregnancy or at birth An infected mother in the United States has more than a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby As growing numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection drug use or infected sexual partners researchers expect a corresponding increase in the numbers of infected children HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV develop a serious AIDS related infection by 3 to 6 years of age These infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of childhood that can result in seizures pneumonia diarrhea and other symptoms leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays At least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older participants All volunteers must have well documented HIV infection but no symptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen liver or spleen They cannot have received any anti retroviral or immune regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study Study chair John S Lambert M D of the University of Rochester Medical School and co chair Samuel Katz M D of Duke University School of Medicine will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara M D medical officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID s division of AIDS We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children for any side effects to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or fevers for example than another said Dr McNamara We ll also look at whether low or

the three HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 48 Volume 6 Number 10 April 20 1993 products The trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from recombinant HIV proteins These so called subunit vaccines each genetically engineered to contain only a piece of the virus have so far proved well tolerated in ongoing trials in HIV infected adults One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc of Meriden Conn contains gp160 a protein that gives rise to HIV s surface proteins plus alum adjuvant Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine Presently alum is the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug Administration Both of the other vaccines one made by Genentech Inc of South San Francisco and the other by Biocine a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA Geigy in Emeryville Calif contain the major HIV surface protein gp120 plus adjuvant The Genentech vaccine contains alum while the Biocine vaccine contains MF59 an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in other Phase I vaccine trials in adults A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 children Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the experimental vaccine and three children will be given adjuvant alone considered the placebo Neither the health care workers nor the children will be told what they receive If the low dose is well tolerated controlled testing of a higher dose of the experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will begin Each child will receive six immunizations one every four weeks for six months and be followed up for 24 weeks after the last immunization For more information about the trial sites or eligibility for enrollment call the AIDS Clinical Trials Information

Newsletter Page 49 Volume 6 Number 10 April 20 1993 NEW EVIDENCE THAT THE HIV CAN CAUSE DISEASE INDEPENDENTLY News from the National Institute of Dental Research There is new evidence that the human immunodeficiency virus can cause disease independently of its ability to suppress the immune system say scientists at the National Institues of Health They report that HIV itself not an opportunistic infection caused scaling skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for HIV Although the HIV genes were active in the mice they did not compromise the animals immunity the researchers found This led them to conclude that the HIV itself caused the skin disease Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease without affecting the immune system said lead author Dr Jeffrey Kopp of the National Institute of Dental Research NIDR Dr Kopp and his colleagues described their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult since most animals including mice cannot be infected by the virus To bypass this problem scientists have developed HIV transgenic mice which carry genes for HIV as well as their own genetic material NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice The resulting litters contained both normal and transgenic animals Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV genetic material in l988 Those mice however became sick and died too soon after birth to study in depth In the present study the scientists used an incomplete copy of HIV which allowed the animals to live longer Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling wart like tumors on their necks and backs Other transgenic mice developed thickened crusting skin lesions that covered most of their bodies resembling psoriasis in humans No skin lesions developed in their normal non transgenic littermates Studies of tissue taken from the wart like skin tumors showed that they were a type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma Although the papillomavirus can cause these skin lesions laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the animals Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the presence of a protein producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 50 Volume 6 Number 10 April 20 1993 Evidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were turned on or active said Dr Kopp The scientists found no evidence however of compromised immunity in the mice no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common infections The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals immune systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the skin lesions Dr Kopp said Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light The light increased HIV genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the genes were responsible for the skin condition the scientists said No lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr Peter Dickie who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Collaborating on the study with Dr Kopp were Mr Charles Wohlenberg Drs Nickolas Dorfman Joseph Bryant Abner Notkins and Paul Klotman all of NIDR Dr Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute and Dr James Rooney formerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 51 Volume 6 Number 10 April 20 1993 Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AIDS H H S N E W S U S DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES March 4 1993 HHS Secretary Donna E Shalala today announced the first nationwide clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care professionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV infection or AIDS The toll free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a physician a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist It provides information on drugs clinical trials and the latest treatment methods The service is funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of San Francisco General Hospital Secretary Shalala said One goal of this project is to share expertise so patients get the best care A second goal is to get more primary health care providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS which reduces treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and community social support networks Currently many providers refer patients with HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience Secretary Shalala said This clinical expertise should be especially helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in communities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available The telephone number for health care professionals is 1 800 933 3413 and it is accessible from 10 30 a m to 8 p m EST 7 30 a m to 5 p m PST Monday through Friday During these times consultants will try to answer questions immediately or within an hour At other times physicians and health care providers can leave an electronic message and questions will be answered as quickly as possible Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question related to providing HIV care including the latest HIV AIDS drug treatment information clinical trials information subspecialty case referral literature searches and other information The service is designed for health care professionals rather than patients families or others who have alternate sources of information or materials When a health care professional calls the new service the call is taken by either a clinical pharmacist primary care physician or family nurse practitioner All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and inpatient primary care for people with HIV related diseases The consultant asks for patient specific information including CD4 cell count current medications sex age and the patient s HIV history This national service has grown out of a 16 month local effort that HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 52 Volume 6 Number 10 April 20 1993 responded to nearly 1 000 calls from health care providers in northern California The initial project was funded by HRSA s Bureau of Health Professions through its Community Provider AIDS Training CPAT project and by the American Academy of Family Physicians When providers expand their knowledge they also improve the quality of care they are able to provide to their patients said HRSA Administrator Robert G Harmon M D M P H This project will be a great resource for health care professionals and the HIV AIDS patients they serve This service has opened a new means of communication between health care professionals and experts on HIV care management

Lines 87 When are we going to hear a Christian answer to this question In paraphrase On what or whose authority do Christians proclaim that they are above the Law and above the Prophets 7 major and 12 minor and not accountable to the Ten Commandments of which Jesus clearly spoke His opinion in Matthew 5 14 19 What is the source of this pseudo doctrine Who is the pseudo teacher Who is the Great Deceiver OK here s at least one Christian s answer Jesus was a JEW not a Christian In this context Matthew 5 14 19 makes sense Matt 5 17 Do not think that I Jesus came to abolish the Law or the Prophets I did not come to abolish but to fulfill Jesus lived under the Jewish law However He was the culmination of the promises of the Prophets He came to fulfill the prophecies and fully obey God s purposes Verse 18 says For truly I say to you until heaven and earth pass away not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law until all is accomplished The key to this verse IMHO is the last phrase Jesus as the fulfillment of the law accomplished what the Law was supposed to accomplish Verse 19 Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments and so teaches others shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever keeps and teaches them he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish people about living lives under the law this makes sense In general it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he must have received about doing away with the Law That was not Jesus intent at all He had come to earth to live the Law as it should be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his people all the way back to Eve Gen 3 15 The serpent will bruise your heel but He will bruise his head Jesus appeared to be doing away with the Law because he did not honor the traditions of men as equal to the Law of God He regularly locked horns with the religious leaders of the day because he would not conform to their rules only God s Law In the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law and defending himself against his accusors Almost the entire Sermon on the Mount Matt 5 7 is dedicated to helping the Jewish people understand the true intent of the Law sweeping away the clutter which had been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions In Galatians 3 23 26 Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the Law in this way 23 But before faith came we were kept in custody under the law being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed 24 Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ that we may be justified by faith 25 But now that faith has come we are no longer under a tutor 26 For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus I believe this says that after Christ was revealed the Law had served it s purpose i e our tutor to lead us to Christ and now we are no longer under a tutor The law has been fulfilled as Christ said he would do God the author of the old Law and the Christ Man Jesus are the same personality Therefore the old Law and the new Testament the last will and testament of Jesus are based on the same moral principles It makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are re expressed in Christianity On the other hand now that the Law has fulfilled it s purpose and Christians relate to God through Christ not the Law it also makes sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to represent the mysteries of this new relationship i e Baptism representing Christ s death burial and resurrection Rom 6 3 8 The Lord s supper as a memorial to His sacrifice I Cor 11 26 and Sunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection Matt 28 1ff Acts 20 7 OK That s one Christian s

These are two conflicting statements To say one is a clarification of the other is a breach of logic I don t mind people shifting their position on an issue It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change was made What about Deuteronomy 22 20 25 Is it wrong now Did Jesus change that If anything He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made In the following verses Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended Sure he does this However he doesn t address the notion of stoning non virgin brides because

Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe in it What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart I ll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible from end to end and don t believe in it Depending on how they use this knowledge they can be scary They can argue any position they desire and back it up with selected parts of the Bible Such Pharisees include David Koresh and Adolph Hitler I will qualify this by saying I don t know if they actually believed what they were preaching but the ends certainly made the means look frightening However just as scary are those that don t know much of the Bible but believe every word In fact this is probably scarier since there are far more of these people from what I ve seen In addition they are very easy to manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees since they don t know enough to debate with these people Christianity is not just a set of rules it s a lifestyle that changes one s perspectives and personal conduct And it demands obedience to God s will No it demands obedience to a book If God came down and personally told me how I should behave then I would say that I would be doing God s will by doing it However if preachers pastors and evangelists tell me to obey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to two millenia even longer for the OT even if I follow everything in it with my heart I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I m doing the will of God Some people can live by it but many others cannot or will not That is their choice

says that Jesus was either a liar or he was crazy a modern day Koresh or he was actually who he said he was Logic alert artificial trifercation The are many other possible explainations Could have been that he never existed There have been some good points made in this group that is not impossible that JC is an amalgam of a number of different myths Mithra comes to mind Some reasons why he wouldn t be a liar are as follows Who would die for a lie Wouldn t people be able to tell if he was a liar People gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing someone who was or had been healed Call me a fool but I believe he did heal people Logic alert argument from incredulity Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn t mean that it isn t true Liars can be very pursuasive just look at Koresh that you yourself site He has followers that don t think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die By not giving up after getting shot himself Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what he believes As far as healing goes If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels In one of them the healing that is done is not any more that faith healers can pull off today Seems to me that the early gospels weren t that compeling so the stories got bigger to appeal better Niether was he a lunatic Would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy Very doubtful in fact rediculous For example anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool logical people see this right away Therefore since he wasn t a liar or a lunatic he must have been the real thing Or might not have existed or any number of things That is the logical pitfall that those who use flawed logic like this fall into There are bifurcations or tri quad etc that are valid because in the proceeding steps the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are possible Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives However if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive then any conclusions bases on the incomplete set are invalid even if the true choice is one of the original choices I have given at least one valid alternative so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn t one of the other two alternative is no longer valid Some other things to note He fulfilled loads of prophecies in the psalms Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone This in his betrayal and Crucifixion I don t have my Bible with me at this moment next time I write I will use it JC was a rabbi He knew what those prophecies were It wouldn t be any great shakes to make sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy What would be compeling is if there were a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then yet fullfilled them anyway I don t think most people understand what a Christian is It is certainly not what I see a lot in churches Rather I think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for God s sake He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the same Hey we can t do it God himself inspires us

reasonable Christians about If only those christian scientists would take note In Australia there is a very strong movement a bunch of christian scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the laws of physics For example there are a few chaps who are trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed light has been rapidly decaying over the years and this has not been accounted for The book says that Jesus was either a liar or he was crazy a modern day Koresh or he was actually who he said he was Or of course that he never existed and the bible was a story and was never intended to become a manifesto for a billion people Did Tony follow that one up Some reasons why he wouldn t be a liar are as follows Who would die for a lie Wouldn t people be able to tell if he was a liar People gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing someone who was or had been healed Millions of people have died for a lie This point is difficult to substantiate since it is not well defined a great many religious arguments work in that way but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the Spanish invaders The list is endless The Aztecs lost BTW Call me a fool but I believe he did heal people That is perfectly reasonable but it is not grounds for me or anyone to become a christian More to the point it does not add weight to the claim that Jesus was the real thing Niether was he a lunatic Would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy Very doubtful in fact rediculous For example anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool logical people see this right away Have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany More to the point did Tony mention this One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his many colleagues fools or illogical men their support of Hitler was based I presume upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with his principles Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler was sane Therefore since he wasn t a liar or a lunatic he must have been the real thing Hmmm I don t think his arguments warrant the use of a Therefore Some other things to note He fulfilled loads of prophecies in the psalms Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone This in his betrayal and Crucifixion I don t have my Bible with me at this moment next time I write I will use it This is unfortunately what alot of religious discussions I have had with people result in quoting the bible The only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to present If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally he or she will end up in all sorts of shit Tony s argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the events described in the bible took place but to convince someone who thinks the bible is total fiction that Jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless For example in mathematics you cannot say a is equal to b because a is equal to b I don t think most people understand what a Christian is That would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed in religious wars and why there are hundreds of

People gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing someone who was or had been healed Call me a fool but I believe he did heal people There is no historical proof of this see earlier threads Besides he or at least his name have been the cause of enough deaths to make up for whatever healing he gave Niether was he a lunatic Would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy SIEG HEIL Very doubtful in fact rediculous For example anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool logical people see this right away Who is David Koresh I am curious Therefore since he wasn t a liar or a lunatic he must have been the real thing How does this follow Your definition of lunatic and disproof thereof seem rather uhhh SHAKY Some other things to note He fulfilled loads of prophecies in the psalms Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone This in his betrayal and Crucifixion I don t have my Bible with me at this moment next time I write I will use it Good idea I don t think most people understand what a Christian is It is certainly not what I see a lot in churches Naturally those or not TRUE Christians right Rather I think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for God s sake He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the same Hey we can t do it God himself inspires us to turn our lives over to him That s tuff and most people don t want to do it to be a real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at But just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes time We don t rush it in one day Christianity is your whole life It is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in a while We box everything into time units Such as work at this time sports Tv social life God is above these boxes and should be carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for ourselves Someone else handle this I don t know if it s worth it sigh Adam John Cooper

I ll typein the handout he gave out at the meeting Here goes The Microlight Solar Sail 1 Introduction The solar sail is a well established concept Harnessing the pressure of sunlight a spacecraft would have unlimited range In principle such a vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people realize The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per square kilometer Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized fabric which would be necessary to transport a conventional type spacecraft is a daunting task This is why despite the potential of hte idea no such craft has actually been launched to date 2 Design Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept a tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely be electronics with no mechanical parts Several attitude control methods are feasible for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data gathering device solar cells providing 1 watt power for control and communication and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface of the sail itself Launched as a piggyback payload the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars 3 Missions The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions For example a It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor groups Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit rate b It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit Previously unobserved areas around the lunar poles could be viewed By angling the sail to reflect sunlight downwards polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could be imaged Bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these locations Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar base BTW c It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet nucleus Impacting at low speed a thin wire probe attached to the craft causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp edged tube like performing a biopsy Returning to Earth the sail acts as an ideal re entry parachute load per unit area 20 gm m2 ensures that heat is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed 300 deg C The material sample is recovered enclosed in a small insulating container Contact Colin Jack Tel 0865 200447 Oxford Mathematical Designs 131 High Street Oxford OX1 4DH England This guy would love to hear from anyone
